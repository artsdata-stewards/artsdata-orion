She later moved to Kyiv, where she finished art school and earned a Master’s degree in Architecture. She spent eight years working in an architectural firm, mostly on reconstruction projects; where she learned to notice the beauty in details and stories hidden in old places.\r\nUkrainian folk art remains her strongest source of inspiration, but she is equally fascinated by the richness of other cultures. “I love to look at everyday things from unexpected angles — from a point of view we don’t usually consider. I try to guide the viewer to that unfamiliar perspective and share the feeling it gives me”, said the artist. Often, this different way of seeing resonates with people and helps them connect with the piece on a deeper level.\r\nThis exhibition is titled&nbsp;Borders&nbsp;because borders are a motif in this artwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you think about it, border is a concept that is rich in meaning. It can mean, for example, a&nbsp;boundary&nbsp;defining one territory and separating it from another (lines on a map); a&nbsp;frame&nbsp;enclosing and drawing attention to what is inside the frame; or a&nbsp;decorative element&nbsp;that is integral to the design of a drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, the border tells a story.

Heralded as “The Maritimes’ most promising young MC” by Complex and “one of this country's most promising young rappers” by CBC Music, his music carries an energy and wisdom beyond his years covering topics about love, loss, celebration, and perseverance.\r\nMixing pop-rap with old school roots, his lyrics have been described as catchy and confessional. A self-described knucklehead with an internet connection, Wolf Castle likes to keep listeners on their toes and deliver a new perspective on being young, indigenous, and proud of it.\r\nEmpress Theatre199 Robinson(General admission - cabaret seating) "

        "@value": "The&nbsp;Capitol Theatre&nbsp;is&nbsp;thrilled&nbsp;to once again partner with&nbsp;Tutta Musica Orchestra&nbsp;(representing the New Brunswick Youth Orchestra) to produce&nbsp;Shrek The Musical, a happily-ever-after adventure filled with ogres, princesses, dragons and swamp-soaked surprises. This&nbsp;professional musical theatre production, graciously sponsored by&nbsp;FunTime Spas &amp; Hot Tubs,&nbsp;will be presented at the&nbsp;magical&nbsp;Capitol Theatre from&nbsp;February 21st&nbsp;to March 1st, 2026.&nbsp;\r\nBased on the Oscar-winning DreamWorks Animation film,&nbsp;Shrek The Musical&nbsp;is a Tony Award-winning fairy tale adventure, featuring all new songs from Jeanine Tesori (Thoroughly Modern Millie; Caroline, or Change) and a side-splitting book by David Lindsay-Abaire.&nbsp;Shrek&nbsp;brings all the beloved characters you know from the film to life on stage and proves there’s more to the story than meets the ears.\r\n\"Once upon a time, there was a little ogre named Shrek....\" And thus begins the tale of an unlikely hero who finds himself on a life-changing journey alongside a wisecracking Donkey and a feisty princess who resists her rescue. Throw in a short-tempered bad guy, a cookie with an attitude and over a dozen other fairy tale misfits, and you’ve got the kind of mess that calls for a real hero. Luckily, there’s one on hand... and his name is Shrek.\r\nShrek The Musical&nbsp;marks the&nbsp;ninth chapter in this ongoing fairy-tale collaboration between&nbsp;Tutta Musica Orchestra&nbsp;and the Capitol Theatre. Since 2016, this partnership has brought to life magical productions such as&nbsp;The Sound of Music&nbsp;(twice!),&nbsp;Oliver!,&nbsp;Mary Poppins,&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast,&nbsp;The Wizard of Oz,&nbsp;The Little Mermaid&nbsp;and last year’s delight,&nbsp;The Addams Family.&nbsp;Each show has been a storybook in its own right, inviting audiences to step beyond the ordinary and into the realm of wonder.\r\nCast – Shrek The Musical 2026\r\nShrek – Daniel WillistonFiona – Rebekah BrownLord Farquaad– Tyler CheckDonkey - TBD\r\nEnsemble: Emma Rudy, Sasha Leblanc, Iris Lloyd, Jamie Cordes, Émilien Cormier, Véronique Hébert, Chloë Gaudet, Megan Fowlie, Lilianne Cormier, Molly Nelson, Erica Mitton, Gabriella Castro-Levesque, Caroline Coon, Bethany Robertson, Ismael Vitriago, Olivier Émond, Matt Kinney, Ashton Leal, Danny Parlee-Robichaud, Ian MacGowan, Zack Lasnel, Owen Leblanc, Chris Meaney, Dominique Melanson and CJ Norris.\r\nShrek the Musical is recommended for ages 5 and up as the show contains mild peril, comical gross-out humor, and elements that could frighten very young or sensitive children, such as strobe and flashing lights.

Artists Leah Ellis, Brieonna Locche and Lucy Farrell love to create and perform charming and engaging musical stories for children.\r\nDuring their performance, they tell original stories of family, kindness, humility and friendship; and sing songs with high-quality instrumental arrangements and intricate three-part harmony. Their stories unfold with the help of a carefully crafted artwork presented on a “crankie”.\r\nThe inspiration for their stories comes from the real life fallibility of the animals and people in our world. Their homespun storytelling speaks of a simpler time, a time where families snuggled around the fire and listened to stories together. They believe in the power of simple, beautiful art and folk music to give young children the space and opportunity to imagine.\r\nPAY WHAT YOU WILLTickets for this performance are on sale at flexible pricing (minimum contribution of $10 per ticket). YOU decide the price of your ticket! We appreciate your generosity.\r\nChildren under two are welcome to attend this performance and will not require a ticket if they are seated on an adult's lap. "

Mackenzie gave up everything: his house, his job, and even the respect of his family to pursue his stand-up dreams. He has never looked back.\r\nAfter years of relentless hustle, that gamble is paying off in a big way. As an independent artist from Prince George, BC, Alex has self-produced all of his own shows without the backing of a major label, and the results speak for themselves. With over 100 million views online, a feature on Amazon Prime, sold-out theatres across Canada and Australia, and an arena performance for over 2,000 fans, Alex is proving that betting on yourself can lead to something incredible.\r\nWhat truly sets Alex apart is the experience he creates. Known as the happiness cheerleader of comedy, his shows feel like you’re hanging out with your best friend: positive, interactive, and full of life. Every night is unique, with crowd work that makes the audience part of the story, brand-new material woven with deep life lessons, and the unmistakable passion of someone who risked it all to chase a dream.\r\nYou might not remember every single joke, but you’ll always remember how it made you feel. Everyone will leave happier than when they arrived, carrying lifelong memories with their loved ones. Even after the lights go down, the joy from this night will stay with you. "

Formed in Adelaide, Australia in 2009, GOM has rocketed to stellar acclaim with a series of disarmingly accomplished ensemble works.\r\nBrought together by their love and passion for circus training, this family of performers are proud to be part of a strong Australian circus scene. GOM is a ‘do it yourself’ ensemble, from creation to direction, marketing to production… everything about this show has their fingerprints all over it. Their work focuses on human connection and acrobatic virtuosity. It is strong, cheeky, daring and innovative, a true product of the ensemble that creates it.\r\nTen Thousand HoursEverybody is a master of something. Blink, step, jump, balance, flip, fly.\r\nThis is an ode to the countless hours needed to achieve great things. A tribute to the dedication required to raise our physical ambitions. An acknowledgement of the backstory that is often more spectacular than the finished product.\r\nEight elite acrobats investigate physical skill; how we obtain it, how we perfect it, and how it can transform our lives. Through highlighting the nuance of high level acrobatics, audiences experience a heightened appreciation of the countless hours required to master the skills they are witnessing. Ten Thousand Hours is a revelry of the distinct physical language that defines GOM and a celebration of the pursuit of mastery.\r\nThis is a love letter to our bodies and the amazing things they let us do every day.\r\nThis is an invitation to watch us work.

Grant’s most personal work to date,&nbsp;Queen of the Strait&nbsp;draws from her childhood in Prince Edward Island and the timeless pull of the Atlantic. The live experience reimagines those songs in motion - a moving meditation on grief, transformation, and the beauty of beginning again.\r\nEach show is an immersive, cinematic experience featuring a live band, curated film sequences, and interpretive movement. Together, these elements create a dreamlike landscape where the songs flow seamlessly into one another.\r\nCo-created with a celebrated team of collaborators including producers Daniel Ledwell and Joshua Van Tassel, Irish director Julie Kelleher, and cinematographer Daniel Grant,&nbsp;Cradled by the Waves&nbsp;invites audiences to reflect on love, loss, and the fragility of life through a communal and deeply emotional lens.\r\nStep through the portal and be part of a shared moment that blurs the line between audience and artist - a living, breathing work of art that changes with every performance.\r\n*Coproduced by Jenn Grant, Blue Grace Music, and the National Arts Centre's National Creation Fund.

A handful of daring acrobats, accompanied by their musicians, perform to the pulsating rhythm of the djembes of Guinea with their authentic and original choreography and acrobatics. With the melodious sound of the kora, Yamoussa Bangoura transports us to a place where the diversity of traditional African arts are illuminated, and combined with the virtuosity of a modern North American Circus performance.\r\nKalabanté Productions was created by Yamoussa Bangoura, a multidisciplinary artist of Guinean origin. Yamoussa’s long term dream was to found a school of circus arts, and direct his own multidisciplinary company specializing in the African arts. As the company director, he develops his own shows which over the past several years have been increasingly gathering attention and recognition in the Quebec circus arts community and worldwide. "

Anchored by the evocative baritone of frontman Paul Murphy, alongside Loel Campbell’s hypnotic, propulsive drumming and Tim D’Eon’s shimmering guitar and piano work, the band conjures a sonic atmosphere that feels both vast and intimate. Their catalog, anchored by critically celebrated albums Untitled, Welcome to the Night Sky, Hello Hum, The Great Detachment&nbsp;and In the Land Of, occupies a distinct place in the Canadian indie rock canon, praised for its deft balance of haunting lyricism and cinematic grandeur.\r\nIn 2025, Wintersleep brings with them a promise of immersive live performances—equal parts raw emotional catharsis and meticulously constructed sonic atmospheres. Longtime fans and new listeners alike will be drawn into the band’s enveloping soundscapes, where intimate confessions collide with epic swells of sound, capturing the delicate tension between vulnerability and grandeur that defines their music.

Next, award-winning choreographer Alysa Pires constructs a striking commentary on the search for true connection and meaning amid disorder. Set to the cinematic melodies of violinist Hilary Hahn and composer Hauschka, Vestiges highlights the virtuosity of Pires’ bold and lively choreography. Rounding out the program, Guillaume Côté, recently retired Principal Dancer and Chorographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada, applies his fresh, artistic vision to a jovial rendition of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Le Carnaval des Animaux, regarded as one of the French composer’s best-known works. Full of whimsical ornamentation, this upbeat ensemble piece pushes the limits of contemporary ballet and promises to delight audiences with its exuberant energy of frolicking and fun.\r\nFounded in 2002, Ballet Kelowna is the sole professional dance company in BC’s Interior. The organization is committed to its role as a leader in the region through encouraging, promoting, and developing Canadian dancers and choreographers. The company performs annually for more than 12,000 audience members in Kelowna and on tour and provides unique dance training opportunities and outreach programs. Its Artistic Director and CEO, Simone Orlando, is an award-winning choreographer and former dancer with Ballet BC and The National Ballet of Canada. Under Orlando’s direction, Ballet Kelowna was named the 2024 Artistic Company of the Year by the BC Live Performance Network (formerly the British Columbia Touring Council) and was an organizational recipient of the Lieutenant Governor’s Arts and Music Award in 2022.

From fan favourites to hidden gems that may have been forgotten. More than a concert, this is a heartfelt reflection of a life in music shared with fans old and new who make it all possible.\r\nFor four decades, the Cape Breton-based family group has been thrilling audiences of all ages, near and far, with their sparkling repertoire, vocals, instrumental prowess and vibrant showmanship.\r\nAs a group, the MacNeil siblings are widely regarded as one of the greatest live concert acts in the Celtic world. Hailing from Sydney Mines, Cape Breton Island, the family group is deeply rooted in Celtic music, culture, dance, language and history. Their numerous critically acclaimed recordings have included their own original songs as well as tried and true standards, both instrumental and vocal.\r\nThe Barra MacNeils live concert experience brings so much more to the stage than most live acts ever can. Multiple lead vocalists, beautiful sibling harmonies, top drawer instrumental prowess on a wide variety of acoustic, stringed, percussion and wind instruments blended with dancing, storytelling, Gaelic songs and a journey through an ancient culture; it is family entertainment at its highest level.\r\nMulti-award winners, the Barra MacNeils have released no less than 17 albums and have been touring the nation, coast to coast, with their beloved Christmas show for 25 years!

Ingrid Hansen animates cheeky vignettes in the palm of her hand and projects them onto a huge screen.\r\nTiny stories emerge that celebrate the hilarious impossibility of being alive and having a body: these fragile bags of meat and bone, carry us from place to place and allow us to laugh and snort and feel. SNAFU’s work has been compared to Wes Anderson and David Lynch, yet “hilarious, absurd and profoundly human,” (the Star Phoenix Newspaper.)\r\n“Utterly magical, insanely inventive, wickedly funny, and beautifully twisted. Imagine Lambchops Puppeteer Shari Lewis's soul possessed by David Lynch. With dark, deadpan humour, Hansen employs video projection to provocative, cinematic effect. ★★★★★ ” - Winnipeg Free Press.“A GENIUS OF PHYSICAL COMEDY.”- Entertainment World.“HILARIOUS. Her physicality is impeccable.”-Star Phoenix.“Unbelievably funny.” - PLANK Magazine“Unbelievably charismatic.” - The Charlebois Post“Remarkable feats of puppetry.” - CBC\r\nPAY WHAT YOU WILLTickets for this performance are on sale at flexible pricing (minimum contribution of $10 per ticket).

Don Morash’s guitar playing makes you feel like Lindsay Buckingham is in the songs. Aran Hill plays a fretless bass that John McVie would be proud to listen to. Maurice Nadeau, drummer for GYPSY, lays down an excellent beat and even looks a bit like Mick Fleetwood.\r\nDon’t miss GYPSY: the band that gives you Fleetwood Mac, songs of Stevie Nicks and even her Duet with Tom Petty.

Selling out once again, he solidified his reputation, showing that his portrayal of Taylor Swift – swiftly becoming a living legend – was indeed his magnum opus.\r\nA journalist from the Toronto Sun Times, who witnessed the spectacle, hailed Jimmy as the definitive Canadian Taylor Swift act, exclaiming, “Jimmy Moore is Taylor Swift! His performance quality is unparalleled!” LCN chimed in as well, dubbing him the “Taylor Swift of Quebec.”\r\nIn the show, Jimmy doesn’t stand alone. A skilled ensemble of dancers and a meticulously designed set underscore his performance, collectively lifting the tribute to extraordinary heights.\r\nDrawing inspiration from the Eras Tour of pop’s reigning queen, Jimmy has firmly established himself as the go-to Taylor Swift impersonator.\r\nFor Swifties missing out on the singer’s iconic tour, Jimmy offers the next best thing.\r\nPlatinum VIP&nbsp;Includes M&amp;G + photo backstage before the show + exclusive giftGold VIP Includes an exclusive gift "
