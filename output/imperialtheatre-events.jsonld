        "@value": "Ann Marie Fleming Canada | 2024 | 110m | English Keira Jang, Joel Oulette, and Sandra Oh star in this introspective live-action and animated feature set in the near future when technology and travel are almost completely banned, and nobody is allowed to live past age 50. Eight years since her last feature, filmmaker, writer, and visual artist Ann Marie Fleming brings her gentle, introspective touch to the timely genre of environmental science fiction. Joined by past collaborator Sandra Oh — who voiced and co-produced Fleming’s Window Horses (TIFF ’16) — and elements of her trademark animation, Can I Get a Witness? tells the story of a mother and daughter in a near-future world where huge sacrifices are made to maintain life on Earth. With its resources swallowed by e-waste and overpopulation, the world is experiencing an anthropogenic collapse. To manage, technological advances are shunned. Nobody has electricity and only people with exceptions are permitted cars. Most importantly, there is also a collective agreement that nobody is allowed to live beyond the age of 50. Oh’s Ellie lives with her teenage daughter Kiah (Keira Jang), who is starting her first day as a Documenter, an important role in this new world order. She uses her artistic gifts — beautifully conjured in animations — to draw the dying ceremonies, since printing and photography have been banned. Kiah is paired with Daniel (Joel Oulette), the young man who performs the contractual elements of each person’s end-of-life ceremony. He matter-of-factly provides the packages a person can choose, sets them up when the time comes, and performs the burials. But his new coworker is having a hard time handling the emotional impacts of the job. With Fleming’s deft touch, Can I Get a Witness? is an inspired look at what memories — and catastrophic climate change — might look like.

Known for his innovative guitar solos and thunderous chords, Morello is a groundbreaking artist both in his solo career and as an original member of the rock bands Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave - two acts responsible for multiple Grammy Awards and a combined 30 million albums sold worldwide. His trademark style was a crucial component of Rage Against the Machine, helping launch Morello and the band to Grammy-winning, multi-platinum success, which in turn led to his recognition by Rolling Stone Magazine as the 18th “Greatest Guitar Player of All-Time” and subsequent induction into both the Rock &amp; Roll and Metal Hall of Fame. After not just one but two multi million selling bands, Morello's signature guitar can be heard in the supergroup Prophets of Rage and with his 6-year stint in Bruce Springsteen’s E-Street Band. Morello is a vocal political activist whose first solo outing was as the Nightwatchman. You can often find him on the front line of pickets and strikes across the country - most recently in solidarity with United Mine Workers of America in Brookwood, AL, the United Farm Workers of America in Sacramento, CA, and the Star Garden Strippers Union in North Hollywood, CA. He is also the 2023 Music Will Humanitarian of the Year recipient, helping to sponsor multiple music education programs across the country for schools in need and is an ACLU Artist for Smart Justice for his advocacy work. Additionally, you can catch him every week on Sirius XM as the host of his show “One Man Revolution.” [embed]https://youtu.be/9CkCgnVWJ-8[/embed] &nbsp;"

You can often find\nhim on the front line of pickets and strikes across the country – most recently in solidarity with United\nMine Workers of America in Brookwood, AL, the United Farm Workers of America in Sacramento, CA,\nand the Star Garden Strippers Union in North Hollywood, CA. He is also the 2023 Music Will\nHumanitarian of the Year recipient, helping to sponsor multiple music education programs across the\ncountry for schools in need and is an ACLU Artist for Smart Justice for his advocacy work. Additionally,\nyou can catch him every week on Sirius XM as the host of his show “One Man Revolution.”\n\n \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTom Morello - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Facebook Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTom Morello on Facebook\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Instagram Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTom Morello on Instagram\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "CCMA winners, and beloved Canadian country superstars George Canyon and Aaron Pritchett unite for their coast to coast Cowboy Christmas tour. With countless accolades between them, and over 25 years of hits, the pair will come together to treat fans to some of their own chart topping songs, as well as some all-time favorite Christmas classics. Truly a show not to be missed, in celebration of the Holiday season.   GEORGE CANYON   George Canyon rose to becoming one of Canada’s hottest Country Music stars in the early 2000’s and has won countless accolades and awards, including Juno Awards, CCMA Awards, and ECMA Awards to name a few. He has been inducted into the Nova Scotia Country Music Hall of Fame, recorded 12 albums, and was presented a certified Platinum Award for his debut album ‘One Good Friend’. With country iconic hits like Just Like You, I Believe in Angels, Drinkin’ Thinkin’, Daughters of the Sun, I Got This, I Want You To Live, Slow Dance and many, many more, he is also a highly regarded humanitarian, strong supporter of the military, and, most important, a proud father and devoted husband.  Canyon’s tireless work as spokesperson for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) and his ongoing support for Canada’s Armed Forces has earned him much National and International recognition. Among them, he was honored with the Humanitarian Award by the Canadian Country Music Association, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal, and was also made the first ever Colonel Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets by the Honourable Peter MacKay, former Minister of National Defense. Outside of his music and charitable work, many people might also recognize George for his numerous roles on the big screen. From Charlie Wells in the hit television show Heartland and the head forest ranger in Trailer Park Boys, to Bull Shelton in the Hallmark Channel’s highest-rated original Christmas movie “One Starry Christmas”. George also guest starred on stage in the musical production of Grease in 2018 at the Winter Garden Theatre in Toronto. Among his many identities, Canyon is also a proud Canadian and huge hockey fan, and roots for his team, the Calgary Flames, for which he is in his sixth season singing the national anthem during the home games. George released his new memoir on November 8th, 2022 with Simon &amp; Schuster Canada, titled ‘My Country’ - a heartfelt and candid memoir charting his humble beginnings in rural Nova Scotia, the hard-won success he found under the bright lights of Nashville, Tennessee, and the life lessons learned on and off the road that ultimately led him home.   AARON PRITCHETT He’s has been a household name in Canadian Country music for 20 years, but when Aaron Pritchett hits the stage, he does so with the energy and intensity of an artist fresh on the scene. Yet despite being known for his dynamic, even raucous, live shows, it’s the classically country gentleman inside of Pritchett that’s made him a fan favourite - and staying force in Canadian country - for more than two decades. With 13 Top Ten hits under hits under his belt [buckle], Pritchett has made a career of seamlessly moving from good ol’ boy anthems like “Hold My Beer” to pop-tinged party pleasers like “Worth a Shot” to heart-string pulling ballads like “Warm Safe Place”. He could have stopped when he had enough to fill a Greatest Hits album - which he did in 2015 - but instead he followed it up with several more including his 2019 #1 single, “Better When I Do”. Throughout it, Pritchett has racked up more than 30 Juno, CCMA, WCMA and BCCMA nominations including multiple wins for Entertainer of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year and a CCMA SOCAN Songwriter of the Year award. With his writing, Pritchett continues to push the boundaries of the country genre. And while he refuses to be pigeon-holed, staying grounded in his roots is one thing he insists on. A philanthropist at heart, in 2022 he launched his Annual Big Wheel Charity Golf Classic. The event has raised more than $150,000 to date for community-minded charities. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhX5RrO9bU"

With countless accolades between them, and over 25 years of hits, the pair will come together to treat fans to some of their own chart topping songs, as well as some all-time favorite Christmas classics. Truly a show not to be missed, in celebration of the Holiday season.\n \nGEORGE CANYON  \nGeorge Canyon rose to becoming one of Canada’s hottest Country Music stars in the early 2000’s and has won countless accolades and awards, including Juno Awards, CCMA Awards, and ECMA Awards to name a few. He has been inducted into the Nova Scotia Country Music Hall of Fame, recorded 12 albums, and was presented a certified Platinum Award for his debut album ‘One Good Friend’. With country iconic hits like Just Like You, I Believe in Angels, Drinkin’ Thinkin’, Daughters of the Sun, I Got This, I Want You To Live, Slow Dance and many, many more, he is also a highly regarded humanitarian, strong supporter of the military, and, most important, a proud father and devoted husband. \nCanyon’s tireless work as spokesperson for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) and his ongoing support for Canada’s Armed Forces has earned him much National and International recognition. Among them, he was honored with the Humanitarian Award by the Canadian Country Music Association, the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Medal, and was also made the first ever Colonel Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets by the Honourable Peter MacKay, former Minister of National Defense.\nOutside of his music and charitable work, many people might also recognize George for his numerous roles on the big screen. From Charlie Wells in the hit television show Heartland and the head forest ranger in Trailer Park Boys, to Bull Shelton in the Hallmark Channel’s highest-rated original Christmas movie “One Starry Christmas”. George also guest starred on stage in the musical production of Grease in 2018 at the Winter Garden Theatre in Toronto.\nAmong his many identities, Canyon is also a proud Canadian and huge hockey fan, and roots for his team, the Calgary Flames, for which he is in his sixth season singing the national anthem during the home games.\nGeorge released his new memoir on November 8th, 2022 with Simon & Schuster Canada, titled ‘My Country’ – a heartfelt and candid memoir charting his humble beginnings in rural Nova Scotia, the hard-won success he found under the bright lights of Nashville, Tennessee, and the life lessons learned on and off the road that ultimately led him home.\n \nAARON PRITCHETT\nHe’s has been a household name in Canadian Country music for 20 years, but when Aaron Pritchett hits the stage, he does so with the energy and intensity of an artist fresh on the scene. Yet despite being known for his dynamic, even raucous, live shows, it’s the classically country gentleman inside of Pritchett that’s made him a fan favourite – and staying force in Canadian country – for more than two decades.\nWith 13 Top Ten hits under hits under his belt [buckle], Pritchett has made a career of seamlessly moving from good ol’ boy anthems like “Hold My Beer” to pop-tinged party pleasers like “Worth a Shot” to heart-string pulling ballads like “Warm Safe Place”. He could have stopped when he had enough to fill a Greatest Hits album – which he did in 2015 – but instead he followed it up with several more including his 2019 #1 single, “Better When I Do”. Throughout it, Pritchett has racked up more than 30 Juno, CCMA, WCMA and BCCMA nominations including multiple wins for Entertainer of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year and a CCMA SOCAN Songwriter of the Year award.\nWith his writing, Pritchett continues to push the boundaries of the country genre. And while he refuses to be pigeon-holed, staying grounded in his roots is one thing he insists on.\nA philanthropist at heart, in 2022 he launched his Annual Big Wheel Charity Golf Classic. The event has raised more than $150,000 to date for community-minded charities.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Coast to Coast Cowboy Christmas - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSecond Performer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "Cape Breton’s Men of the Deeps chorus invite you to a Coal Miner’s Christmas performance. Featuring selections from their brand-new 2025 Christmas compilation, December Coal and their much-loved Christmas in the Mine album. The jolly miners are excited to deliver two uplifting hours of songs and stories, belly laughs and maybe even a step or two. You’ll hear new renditions of old songs, original compositions never heard before and more! Make North America's only coal miners' chorus part of your holiday season. ABOUT THE MEN OF THE DEEPS - est. 1966 For nearly sixty years, Cape Breton’s Men of the Deeps choir have been travelling the world as Canadian Ambassadors, singing and storytelling to give us a sense of what life was life for a miner and his family, in a mining town. Preserving our unique Cape Breton history, folklore, culture and talent. The choir has toured throughout Canada and most of the United States, China and Kosovo. They have been to the Northwest Territories and as far south as Arizona, Alabama, Florida and the Appalachian coal mining communities of Kentucky, Virginia and Pennsylvania. They have even performed in Las Vegas, Nevada. Today, the Men of the Deeps are so much more than just a singing group; they are a social institution. The camaraderie amongst the members carries over to their audiences wherever they perform. Clad in authentic mining coveralls and hard hats, they make an impressive impact when they enter a concert hall in total darkness using only the lamps on their helmets for light. AUDIENCE FEEDBACK “...the most amazing Christmas concert I have ever been to!” - Sandra M.\", Guysborough, N.S. “The men sing with so much passion, making every concert a heartfelt night of song and stories that is so enjoyable!” - Jean &amp; Dennis M., Sydney “Just bought and listened to “Christmas in the Mine” for the first time, it is Fantastic! Thank-you.” - Daniel P. , Wainfleet, Ontario “I have never been to a concert when I was made to feel like it wasn’t a concert. It WAS a Cape Breton kitchen party... Thanks for the trip down home! “ - Deb W., Chatham, Ontario \"I was sitting in the balcony of the theatre with my aunt. We were singing, dancing, I laughed, I cried...I have recommended this show to people and I will most definitely see it again!” - Valerie L., North Bay, Ontario"

Featuring selections from their brand-new 2025 Christmas\ncompilation, December Coal and their much-loved Christmas in the Mine album.\nThe jolly miners are excited to deliver two uplifting hours of songs and stories,\nbelly laughs and maybe even a step or two. You’ll hear new renditions of old\nsongs, original compositions never heard before and more! Make North America’s\nonly coal miners’ chorus part of your holiday season.\nABOUT THE MEN OF THE DEEPS – est. 1966\nFor nearly sixty years, Cape Breton’s Men of the Deeps choir have been travelling\nthe world as Canadian Ambassadors, singing and storytelling to give us a sense of\nwhat life was life for a miner and his family, in a mining town. Preserving our\nunique Cape Breton history, folklore, culture and talent.\nThe choir has toured throughout Canada and most of the United States, China and\nKosovo. They have been to the Northwest Territories and as far south as Arizona,\nAlabama, Florida and the Appalachian coal mining communities of Kentucky,\nVirginia and Pennsylvania. They have even performed in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nToday, the Men of the Deeps are so much more than just a singing group; they are\na social institution. The camaraderie amongst the members carries over to their\naudiences wherever they perform. Clad in authentic mining coveralls and hard\nhats, they make an impressive impact when they enter a concert hall in total\ndarkness using only the lamps on their helmets for light.\nAUDIENCE FEEDBACK\n“…the most amazing Christmas concert I have ever been to!”\n– Sandra M.”, Guysborough, N.S.\n“The men sing with so much passion, making every concert a heartfelt night of song\nand stories that is so enjoyable!” – Jean & Dennis M., Sydney\n“Just bought and listened to “Christmas in the Mine” for the first time, it is Fantastic!\nThank-you.” – Daniel P. , Wainfleet, Ontario\n“I have never been to a concert when I was made to feel like it wasn’t a concert. It\nWAS a Cape Breton kitchen party… Thanks for the trip down home! “ – Deb W.,\nChatham, Ontario\n“I was sitting in the balcony of the theatre with my aunt. We were singing, dancing, I\nlaughed, I cried…I have recommended this show to people and I will most definitely\nsee it again!” – Valerie L., North Bay, Ontario\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Facebook Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMen of the Deeps - Coal Miner's Christmas on Facebook\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Other Muppets — Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie Bear and Sam the Eagle — weave in and out of the story, while Scrooge receives visits from spirits of three Christmases — past, present and future. They show him the error of his self-serving ways, but the miserable old man seems to be past any hope of redemption and happiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "Payal Kapadia France, India, Netherlands, Luxembourg | 2024 | 118m | Malayalam, Hindi Moving from urban bustle to seaside idyll, this exquisitely beautiful and heartfelt fiction feature debut from Payal Kapadia (A Night of Knowing Nothing) follows two nurses experiencing personal turning points tinged with the possibility of romance. Following her celebrated documentary A Night of Knowing Nothing (TIFF ’21), writer-director Payal Kapadia’s fiction feature debut follows two women at turning points. Moving from urban bustle to seaside idyll, All We Imagine as Light locates dreamlike reverie in emotional shifts and everyday experiences. Prabha (Kani Kusruti) and Anu (Divya Prabha) are roommates and nurses at a Mumbai hospital. Prabha is married, but her husband went abroad to work many years ago. Now drifting into middle age, she focuses on her job. Anu, by contrast, is young and full of dreams for her future, which she hopes will include the handsome Muslim boy she’s secretly seeing. Prabha initially regards the potentially scandalous affair as an annoyance, but she comes to sympathize with Anu’s passion, perhaps because she, too, feels the tug of frustrated ardour, thanks to the attentions of a poetry-writing doctor. When Prabha’s friend Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam) is evicted from her home by heartless developers, she decides to return to the coastal village of her youth. Prabha and Anu tag along for a holiday. Far from the city’s perpetual clamour, the women’s feelings and sense of life’s possibilities are given free rein. Working again with cinematographer Ranabir Das, Kapadia crafts exquisite beauty from images as simple as people wending through a crowded marketplace or women retrieving laundry from a rooftop clothesline. Yet for all the rapturous visuals, nothing in this heartfelt film is more striking than seeing Prabha and Anu forging their connection. Their sisterhood emerges slowly and is all the more moving for its measured pace."

Moving from urban bustle to seaside idyll, All We Imagine as Light locates dreamlike reverie in emotional shifts and everyday experiences.\nPrabha (Kani Kusruti) and Anu (Divya Prabha) are roommates and nurses at a Mumbai hospital. Prabha is married, but her husband went abroad to work many years ago. Now drifting into middle age, she focuses on her job. Anu, by contrast, is young and full of dreams for her future, which she hopes will include the handsome Muslim boy she’s secretly seeing. Prabha initially regards the potentially scandalous affair as an annoyance, but she comes to sympathize with Anu’s passion, perhaps because she, too, feels the tug of frustrated ardour, thanks to the attentions of a poetry-writing doctor.\nWhen Prabha’s friend Parvaty (Chhaya Kadam) is evicted from her home by heartless developers, she decides to return to the coastal village of her youth. Prabha and Anu tag along for a holiday. Far from the city’s perpetual clamour, the women’s feelings and sense of life’s possibilities are given free rein.\nWorking again with cinematographer Ranabir Das, Kapadia crafts exquisite beauty from images as simple as people wending through a crowded marketplace or women retrieving laundry from a rooftop clothesline. Yet for all the rapturous visuals, nothing in this heartfelt film is more striking than seeing Prabha and Anu forging their connection. Their sisterhood emerges slowly and is all the more moving for its measured pace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

In 2014, Sydney Mines, Cape Breton Island-based family group the Barra MacNeils celebrated 27 years of an outstanding recording and touring career. 2012 featured Live In Concert symphony project recorded in Halifax’s Rebecca Cohn Auditorium over two nights with Symphony Nova Scotia and a special Celtic Colours recording project featuring a wide variety of musical guests from the folk, Americana and Celtic music worlds.  In December, 2013, the group released a third Christmas recording: O Christmas Three supported by another run in their annual seasonal Christmas tours. Other recent releases have covered the span of their entire career, as well as live concerts reflecting the musical course of their career, from humble family beginnings to worldwide acclaim. The concert touring in support of these projects has taken the group to theatre and festival stages coast to coast across Canada, had them jetting across America from festival stage to theatre stages and beyond, as well as sending them to Ireland and Scotland for prestigious events across the Atlantic. As a group, the MacNeil siblings are widely regarded as one of the greatest live concert acts in the Celtic world. Hailing from Sydney Mines, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, the family group is deeply rooted in Celtic music, culture, dance, language and history. Their numerous critically acclaimed recordings have included their own original songs as well as tried and true standards, both instrumental and vocal. The Barra MacNeils live concert experience brings so much more to the stage than most live acts ever can. Multiple lead vocalists, beautiful sibling harmonies, top drawer instrumental prowess on a wide variety of acoustic, stringed, percussion and wind instruments blended with dancing, storytelling, Gaelic songs and a journey through an ancient culture; it is family entertainment at its highest level. Steeped in Cape Breton tradition with strong Celtic roots and musical artistry, this diverse and talented family group continues to wow audiences around the world with their captivating vocals, harmonies and extraordinary musicianship. Multi-award winners, the Barra MacNeils have released no less than 17 recordings  including: O Christmas Three (2013), The Celtic Colours Sessions (2012), Live in Concert with Symphony Nova Scotia (2012), In Concert (2009), In Session (2009), 20th Anniversary Collection (2007), Christmas Album II (2006), All At Once (2005), Racket In the Attic (2002), Christmas Album (1999), Until Now (1997), The Question(1995), The Traditional Album (1994), Closer to Paradise (1993 – Certified Gold in Canada), Timeframe (1990), Rock in the Stream (1989), The Barra MacNeils (1986). In 2001, they released a DVD titled Cape Breton Christmas incorporating music from their live Christmas Concert Special (as seen on television), plus a visit to Cape Breton, interviews with the Barra MacNeils home at Christmas and music videos. Canada’s Celtic ambassadors, the Barra MacNeils continue to perform to sold out audiences throughout Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, the United Kingdom and Europe. From headlining major festivals, concerts, special guest appearances (Rita MacNeils CTV Christmas Special, performing with The Chieftains) television specials, film and television placement (Men with Brooms Soundtrack; Racket In The Attic) and their annual Christmas tour, they have set the course with a solid foundation for success. The Barra MacNeils one-hour Christmas Television Special (2000) continues to be broadcast on Country Music Television (CMT) and on the Public Broadcasting Services (PBS) network in the United States. December 2007 saw the broadcast of a new Christmas Special which will no doubt also become part of the holiday season for years to come. The Barra MacNeils continues to do what they love to do best, and that is playing their music for the fans. This incredibly talented family group tours Canada, the US and Europe to spread their distinctive brand of Celtic music worldwide. [embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y70T54pJ35o[/embed]"

        "@value": "“The Maritimes’ most promising young MC” - Complex “one of this country's most promising young rappers” - CBC Music — Wolf Castle is an Indigenous Mi’kmaq rapper, producer, and singer from Pabineau First Nation, New Brunswick - an unlikely place for a rap career to come to fruition but everything about Wolf Castle defies the odds. Growing up on the reserve with a supportive family of artists, movie directors and musicians, going for a career in the arts seemed like the natural choice.

Heralded as “The Maritimes’ most promising young MC” by Complex and “one of this country’s most promising young rappers” by CBC Music, his music carries an energy and wisdom beyond his years covering topics about love, loss, celebration, and perseverance. \n\nMixing pop-rap with old school roots, his lyrics have been described as catchy and confessional. A self-described knucklehead with an internet connection, Wolf Castle likes to keep listeners on their toes and deliver a new perspective on being young, indigenous, and proud of it.\n——-\nWith The Olympic Symphonium:\n\nOver the past two years, Wolf Castle has been joined by Fredericton-based group The Olympic Symphonium as his live band and recently, thanks to the Greville Tapes Music Club project, the two acts have been collaborating on original material fusing elements of hip-hop, jazz, and folk music into something truly original.  \n \nSTEPHEN HERO makes raw, working class, alternative hip hop from Canada’s east coast.

His latest album, The Hammer &amp; The Rose, is a veritable garden of heart; a (mostly) delicate collection of tender folk and stirring soul numbers that find the New Brunswick-born songwriter thoughtfully tending to the most important things in life. Andersen’s stage presence is informed by decades of cutting his teeth in dusty clubs, dim-lit bars, and grand theatres all over the world, delivering moving performances that run the gamut from intimate to wall-shaking. In the studio, he’s always brought the same attention to detail and commitment to craft as he has to his live show, and the result - a multi-faceted and poignant body of work - has led him to amass over 33 million streams on Spotify and 30 million views on YouTube. In addition to headlining major festivals, clubs and theatres throughout North America, Europe, and Australia, he has shared the stage and toured with Marcus King, Beth Hart, Marty Stuart, Greg Allman, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Randy Bachman, Serena Ryder, Tab Benoit, and more. Andersen nabbed the 2013 and 2016 European Blues Awards for Best Solo/Acoustic Act, was the first ever Canadian to take home top honours in the solo category at the 2010 International Blues Challenge in Memphis, won the CIMA Road Gold award in 2015, and has won multiple Maple Blues Awards. Matt Andersen &amp; The Big Bottle of Joy was nominated for a Juno Award in 2024."

A domestic worker by day, Kwazibani was a “Sangoma” or “African medicine woman” with a natural gift for music. Nomfusi would accompany her mother to weekly Sangoma rituals known as “Intlombe,” where she soon developed a love for performing and crafted her artistic identity by dancing and singing for hours. Tragically in 1998, Nomfusi was suddenly orphaned at age twelve when she lost her mother to HIV/AIDS. Nomfusi’s aunt took her and her siblings in, but sadly also succumbed to the same deadly disease three years later. Undeterred by the hand she was dealt at such a young age, Nomfusi turned her situation around to become one of South Africa's brightest, most recognizable stars. Never one for self-pity, Nomfusi strives to inspire others with her worldview that “life is about choices” and that \"one has to overcome the poverty of the mind first.” Her compassion has led her to doing outreach work at schools for at-risk youth in Soweto, Swaziland, and Malawi, and creating opportunities she didn’t have for the next generation. Additionally, she recently became an ambassador for MES, a Hillbrow-based NPO that helps homeless individuals get back on their feet and reintegrate into society. &nbsp;"

A domestic worker by day, Kwazibani was a “Sangoma” or “African medicine woman” with a natural gift for music. Nomfusi would accompany her mother to weekly Sangoma rituals known as “Intlombe,” where she soon developed a love for performing and crafted her artistic identity by dancing and singing for hours.\nTragically in 1998, Nomfusi was suddenly orphaned at age twelve when she lost her mother to HIV/AIDS. Nomfusi’s aunt took her and her siblings in, but sadly also succumbed to the same deadly disease three years later. Undeterred by the hand she was dealt at such a young age, Nomfusi turned her situation around to become one of South Africa’s brightest, most recognizable stars. Never one for self-pity, Nomfusi strives to inspire others with her worldview that “life is about choices” and that “one has to overcome the poverty of the mind first.” Her compassion has led her to doing outreach work at schools for at-risk youth in Soweto, Swaziland, and Malawi, and creating opportunities she didn’t have for the next generation. Additionally, she recently became an ambassador for MES, a Hillbrow-based NPO that helps homeless individuals get back on their feet and reintegrate into society.\n \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNomfusi - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Presented by Walmart on tour from September 2025. In this a-MEOW-zing new live show, Gabby unboxes a special acorn that needs the magical touch of a rainbow to grow. But when CatRat causes a color cat-astrophe and breaks the rainbow, Gabby and the Gabby Cats must find the colors again to set things right. Gabby’s Dollhouse Live! Presented by Walmart brings to life an original story featuring incredible puppets, dynamic staging, and songs that will have audiences singing and dancing along, from beginning to end.\nTickets on sale now – sign up at www.gabbysdollhouselive.com for pre-sale access.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

While upholding his status as a perennial merrymaker -- a reputation burnished by his years with acclaimed folk-pop combo Great Big Sea -- the new album also finds the multifaceted singer-songwriter and 14-time JUNO Award nominee exploring novel sonic terrain. Alongside marquee co-writers Jimmy Rankin, Donovan Woods, and Hollywood actor Oscar Isaac (yep, of Star Wars fame), Doyle presents nine original songs that are both typically buoyant and surprisingly intimate, what Doyle refers to as \"the lower and slower: the lower part of my vocal range and the slower songs.

While upholding his status as a perennial merrymaker — a reputation burnished by his years with acclaimed folk-pop combo Great Big Sea — the new album also finds the multifaceted singer-songwriter and 14-time JUNO Award nominee exploring novel sonic terrain. Alongside marquee co-writers Jimmy Rankin, Donovan Woods, and Hollywood actor Oscar Isaac (yep, of Star Wars fame), Doyle presents nine original songs that are both typically buoyant and surprisingly intimate, what Doyle refers to as “the lower and slower: the lower part of my vocal range and the slower songs. I’m letting myself do that for the first time on this records,” which he cut in Montreal with producer-engineer Marcus Paquin. Doyle’s CV is extensive — he is a thrice-published author, a film and TV actor-producer with multiple major credits, and the co-producer of the recently released, 20-song Ron Hynes tribute album, Sonny Don’t Go Away.

Disguised as men, Irish swashbuckler Anne Bonny and English privateer-turned-pirate Mary Read looted, plundered and outfought many of their male counterparts throughout the Caribbean before being captured and sentenced to hang. Clashing sword fights, brutal wrestling matches and sharp-as-a-blade humour bring these historical figures to the stage to explore what a life well lived truly is.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTheatre New Brunswick: Heroine - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Expansive and declarative, Further From the Country is the work of an artist who meets the challenge of putting incisive and enduring words to this age of uncertainty. William Prince’s perspective - a songwriter who carries great legacies of family and songcraft forward - is singular and significant. Further From the Country, his fifth LP, is an extraordinary work of observation, reflection and ambition, a work that will leave its mark on listeners for its humanity and its potency. The two-time JUNO Award winning artist continues to build an exceptional body of acclaimed work, with recent accolades including the John Prine Songwriter Fellowship and Americana Honors &amp; Awards nomination. From Newport Folk Festival to sold out shows at prestigious theatres including Massey Hall, from NPR’s Tiny Desk to tours with The War and Treaty, Yola and more, William Prince has made significant appearances on historic stages. Celebrated by peers, critics and fans, William Prince’s songs resonate on deep emotional levels. Now, with Further From the Country, Prince expands his sound and sharpens his focus for a collection of songs that share personal and universal truths alike. A commanding and accomplished album, Further From the Country signals an artist who has impelled his craft to formidable new heights."

Expansive and declarative, Further From the Country is the work of an artist who meets the challenge of putting incisive and enduring words to this age of uncertainty. William Prince’s perspective – a songwriter who carries great legacies of family and songcraft forward – is singular and significant. Further From the Country, his fifth LP, is an extraordinary work of observation, reflection and ambition, a work that will leave its mark on listeners for its humanity and its potency.\nThe two-time JUNO Award winning artist continues to build an exceptional body of acclaimed work, with recent accolades including the John Prine Songwriter Fellowship and Americana Honors & Awards nomination. From Newport Folk Festival to sold out shows at prestigious theatres including Massey Hall, from NPR’s Tiny Desk to tours with The War and Treaty, Yola and more, William Prince has made significant appearances on historic stages. Celebrated by peers, critics and fans, William Prince’s songs resonate on deep emotional levels.\nNow, with Further From the Country, Prince expands his sound and sharpens his focus for a collection of songs that share personal and universal truths alike. A commanding and accomplished album, Further From the Country signals an artist who has impelled his craft to formidable new heights.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWilliam Prince - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "Member pre-sale: Nov 7 | Public onsale: Nov 10 Alex Mackenzie is taking the comedy world by storm, and his Never Been Better tour proves why. Mackenzie gave up everything: his house, his job, and even the respect of his family to pursue his stand-up dreams. He has never looked back. After years of relentless hustle, that gamble is paying off in a big way. As an independent artist from Prince George, BC, Alex has self-produced all of his own shows without the backing of a major label, and the results speak for themselves. With over 100 million views online, a feature on Amazon Prime, sold-out theatres across Canada and Australia, and an arena performance for over 2,000 fans, Alex is proving that betting on yourself can lead to something incredible. What truly sets Alex apart is the experience he creates. Known as the happiness cheerleader of comedy, his shows feel like you’re hanging out with your best friend: positive, interactive, and full of life. Every night is unique, with crowd work that makes the audience part of the story, brand-new material woven with deep life lessons, and the unmistakable passion of someone who risked it all to chase a dream. You might not remember every single joke, but you’ll always remember how it made you feel. Everyone will leave happier than when they arrived, carrying lifelong memories with their loved ones. Even after the lights go down, the joy from this night will stay with you."

Mackenzie gave up everything: his house, his job, and even the respect of his family to pursue his stand-up dreams. He has never looked back. After years of relentless hustle, that gamble is paying off in a big way. As an independent artist from Prince George, BC, Alex has self-produced all of his own shows without the backing of a major label, and the results speak for themselves. With over 100 million views online, a feature on Amazon Prime, sold-out theatres across Canada and Australia, and an arena performance for over 2,000 fans, Alex is proving that betting on yourself can lead to something incredible. What truly sets Alex apart is the experience he creates. Known as the happiness cheerleader of comedy, his shows feel like you’re hanging out with your best friend: positive, interactive, and full of life. Every night is unique, with crowd work that makes the audience part of the story, brand-new material woven with deep life lessons, and the unmistakable passion of someone who risked it all to chase a dream. You might not remember every single joke, but you’ll always remember how it made you feel. Everyone will leave happier than when they arrived, carrying lifelong memories with their loved ones. Even after the lights go down, the joy from this night will stay with you.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Mackenzie - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Tom is often called the godfather of the podcasting revolution, who inspired a generation of voices to find their platform.\n\n\nTom Green VIP Meet & Greet Add-On\n$62.50 // The VIP Meet & Greet will take place after the performance.

A tribute to the dedication required to realise our physical ambitions. An acknowledgement of the backstory that is often more spectacular than the finished product. Eight world class acrobats investigate physical skill; how we obtain it, how we perfect it, and how it can transform our lives. Through highlighting the nuance of high-level acrobatics, audiences experience a heightened appreciation of the countless hours required to master the skills they are witnessing. This is a love letter to our bodies and the amazing things they let us do every day. This is an invitation to watch us work.

The ballet adaptation is set to Mendelssohn’s 1827 concert overture and 1843 instrumental score which includes the famous “Wedding March.” Ballet: A Canadian Way Bengt Jörgen will bring this story to life in his own original ballet version as a tribute to Canada’s North. Ballet Jörgen’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream will bring out the magic of Northern Canada’s woodland and tundra landscapes and creatures of the forest such as moose, beavers, bears, and squirrels. In addition to our professional dancers, each performance will include up to 10 age-appropriate roles for local young aspiring dancers, ages 9 to 17, through Ballet Jörgen's Local Participant Program.

        "@value": "Kalabanté Productions was created by Yamoussa Bangoura, a multidisciplinary artist of Guinean origin.  Yamoussa’s long term dream was the founding of a school of circus arts, and direct his own multidisciplinary company specializing in the African arts.  As the company director he develops his own shows which over the past several years have been increasingly gathering attention and recognition in the Quebec circus arts community and worldwide.  Kô Ryass, and other shows such as Kumbaya, Uno, Kira Nene and Afrique en Cirque have been created and performed worldwide.  Several new projects are in development for the coming years, which will continue to disseminate and promote the values of the company. Yamoussa first became interested in the Circus Arts as a young man growing up in Conakry Guinea in the 1990’s.   He studied the circus performers he saw on European TV and practiced on the beach and dirt around his home. He also studied the Nyamakala tradition of circus, practiced by the Fula people of West Africa. He eventually joined Guinea’s original circus company, Circus Baobob. with whom he toured Africa and Europe.  With this company he was able to spend time in Spain and France where he honed many of the European style circus skills. In the early 2000’s, he was recruited to come to Canada with Cirque Eloize, a Montreal based Canadian cirque company.  [embed]https://youtu.be/7jmTvOG4jJI[/embed]"

With Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe’s compelling taqəš, Alysa Pires’ striking Vestiges, and Guillaume Côté’s electrifying Le Carnaval des Animaux, this high-energy program from Canada’s leading dancemakers promises to please a wide range of spectators. Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe brings his classical ballet training, knowledge of traditional Coast Salish, Grass, and Hoop Dance, and experience as a contemporary dancer to taqəš [tawKESH], which means “to return something” in Ayajuthem, the language belonging to the Homalco, Klahoose, K’omoks, and Tla’amin Nations. Set to several songs by Polaris Prize-winning composer and singer Jeremy Dutcher, taqəš follows the traditional story “Raven Returns the Water,” centred around ῤoho (raven) and walθ (frog).  Next, award-winning choreographer Alysa Pires constructs a striking commentary on the search for true connection and meaning amid disorder. Set to the cinematic melodies of violinist Hilary Hahn and composer Hauschka, Vestiges highlights the virtuosity of Pires’ bold and lively choreography. Rounding out the program, Guillaume Côté, recently retired Principal Dancer and Chorographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada, applies his fresh, artistic vision to a jovial rendition of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Le Carnaval des Animaux, regarded as one of the French composer’s best-known works. Full of whimsical ornamentation, this upbeat ensemble piece pushes the limits of contemporary ballet and promises to delight audiences with its exuberant energy of frolicking and fun. taqəš Choreography: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe Music: Jeremy Dutcher, Oqiton, Essuwonike, Ultestakon | Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa Lighting Design: Rylee Block after James Proudfoot Costume Concept: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe Dancers: TBD Pause &nbsp; Vestiges Choreography: Alysa Pires Music: Hilary Hahn and Hauschka Lighting Design: Rylee Block Costume Concept: Alysa Pires Costume Couturier: Colleen Bryant | KOCO Dancers: TBD Intermission &nbsp; Le Carnaval des Animaux Choreography: Guillaume Côté Music: Camille Saint-Saëns, Le Carnaval des animaux Lighting Design: Rylee Block Costumes: TBD Dancers: TBD &nbsp; CAMERON sinkʷə FRASER-MONROE | Choreographer, taqəš Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe is a member of the Tla’amin First Nation. At three years old he started Ukrainian dancing in Vernon, BC. He was privileged to receive several years of training and performance with World Champion hoop dancer Dallas Arcand and studied grass dance with Elder Mollie Bono. Since graduating from the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School on the RWB Alumni Scholarship, he has performed with many companies including Dancers of Damelahamid at Kia Mau Festival in New Zealand and the International Cervantino Festival, Jera Wolfe at Jacob’s Pillow Festival, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet at the National Arts Centre, the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada, and Ballet Kelowna.  As a choreographer, Mr. Fraser-Monroe has received commissions from The National Ballet of Canada, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Fall for Dance Festival in NYC, Ballet Kelowna, the Winnipeg Summer Dance Collective, Whim W’Him Seattle, the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto, Artist’s Climate Collective, Transformation Cabaret at the Cultch, and both PULSE and Indigenous Day Live! on APTN. He continues to practice and present hoop dance. &nbsp; ALYSA PIRES | Choreographer, MAMBO Alysa Pires was born and raised on the traditional territory of the W̱SÁNEĆ people near Victoria, BC. She is an Honours BFA graduate of Toronto Metropolitan University and her choreographic works have been performed by companies such as The National Ballet of Canada, Alberta Ballet, Ballet Kelowna, Canada’s Ballet Jörgen, and Ballet Edmonton. Ms. Pires began working with the National Ballet of Canada as part of their Choreographic Workshop (2016-2018) where she created her critically acclaimed work In Between. She represented the company at the 13th International Competition for the Erik Bruhn Prize and was then appointed Choreographic Associate by Karen Kain, a position Ms. Pires held from 2019-2022. Ms. Pires recently became the first Canadian woman to create a work for New York City Ballet, making her Lincoln Center debut in May 2023 with Standard Deviation.  &nbsp; GUILLAUME CÔTÉ | Choreographer, Le Carnaval des Animaux Guillaume Côté studied at Canada’s National Ballet School and joined The National Ballet of Canada in 1998. He quickly rose through the ranks and was promoted to Principal Dancer in 2004. In 2013, in addition to his position as a Principal Dancer, Mr. Côté assumed the role of Choreographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada. Since then, eight of his pieces have entered the Company’s repertoire including, most recently, Being and Nothingness performed on an international tour to Russia. His first full-length ballet Le Petit Prince was presented by The National Ballet to sold-out houses in 2016. In 2018, Mr. Côté created in collaboration with the famed Director Robert Lepage, Frame by Frame, a new full-length evening. Mr. Côté is also the Artistic Director of the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur, one of the largest summer dance festivals in the country."

With Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe’s compelling taqəš, Alysa Pires’ striking Vestiges, and Guillaume Côté’s electrifying Le Carnaval des Animaux, this high-energy program from Canada’s leading dancemakers promises to please a wide range of spectators.\nCameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe brings his classical ballet training, knowledge of traditional Coast Salish, Grass, and Hoop Dance, and experience as a contemporary dancer to taqəš [tawKESH], which means “to return something” in Ayajuthem, the language belonging to the Homalco, Klahoose, K’omoks, and Tla’amin Nations. Set to several songs by Polaris Prize-winning composer and singer Jeremy Dutcher, taqəš follows the traditional story “Raven Returns the Water,” centred around ῤoho (raven) and walθ (frog). \nNext, award-winning choreographer Alysa Pires constructs a striking commentary on the search for true connection and meaning amid disorder. Set to the cinematic melodies of violinist Hilary Hahn and composer Hauschka, Vestiges highlights the virtuosity of Pires’ bold and lively choreography.\nRounding out the program, Guillaume Côté, recently retired Principal Dancer and Chorographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada, applies his fresh, artistic vision to a jovial rendition of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Le Carnaval des Animaux, regarded as one of the French composer’s best-known works. Full of whimsical ornamentation, this upbeat ensemble piece pushes the limits of contemporary ballet and promises to delight audiences with its exuberant energy of frolicking and fun.\ntaqəš\nChoreography: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe\nMusic: Jeremy Dutcher, Oqiton, Essuwonike, Ultestakon | Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa\nLighting Design: Rylee Block after James Proudfoot\nCostume Concept: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe\nDancers: TBD\n\nPause\n \nVestiges\nChoreography: Alysa Pires\nMusic: Hilary Hahn and Hauschka\nLighting Design: Rylee Block\nCostume Concept: Alysa Pires\nCostume Couturier: Colleen Bryant | KOCO\nDancers: TBD\n\nIntermission\n \nLe Carnaval des Animaux\nChoreography: Guillaume Côté\nMusic: Camille Saint-Saëns, Le Carnaval des animaux\nLighting Design: Rylee Block\nCostumes: TBD\nDancers: TBD\n \nCAMERON sinkʷə FRASER-MONROE | Choreographer, taqəš \n\nCameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe is a member of the Tla’amin First Nation. At three years old he started Ukrainian dancing in Vernon, BC. He was privileged to receive several years of training and performance with World Champion hoop dancer Dallas Arcand and studied grass dance with Elder Mollie Bono. Since graduating from the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School on the RWB Alumni Scholarship, he has performed with many companies including Dancers of Damelahamid at Kia Mau Festival in New Zealand and the International Cervantino Festival, Jera Wolfe at Jacob’s Pillow Festival, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet at the National Arts Centre, the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada, and Ballet Kelowna. \nAs a choreographer, Mr. Fraser-Monroe has received commissions from The National Ballet of Canada, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Fall for Dance Festival in NYC, Ballet Kelowna, the Winnipeg Summer Dance Collective, Whim W’Him Seattle, the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto, Artist’s Climate Collective, Transformation Cabaret at the Cultch, and both PULSE and Indigenous Day Live! on APTN. He continues to practice and present hoop dance.\n \nALYSA PIRES | Choreographer, MAMBO\n\nAlysa Pires was born and raised on the traditional territory of the W̱SÁNEĆ people near Victoria, BC. She is an Honours BFA graduate of Toronto Metropolitan University and her choreographic works have been performed by companies such as The National Ballet of Canada, Alberta Ballet, Ballet Kelowna, Canada’s Ballet Jörgen, and Ballet Edmonton. Ms. Pires began working with the National Ballet of Canada as part of their Choreographic Workshop (2016-2018) where she created her critically acclaimed work In Between. She represented the company at the 13th International Competition for the Erik Bruhn Prize and was then appointed Choreographic Associate by Karen Kain, a position Ms. Pires held from 2019-2022. Ms. Pires recently became the first Canadian woman to create a work for New York City Ballet, making her Lincoln Center debut in May 2023 with Standard Deviation. \n \nGUILLAUME CÔTÉ | Choreographer, Le Carnaval des Animaux\n\nGuillaume Côté studied at Canada’s National Ballet School and joined The National Ballet of Canada in 1998. He quickly rose through the ranks and was promoted to Principal Dancer in 2004. In 2013, in addition to his position as a Principal Dancer, Mr. Côté assumed the role of Choreographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada. Since then, eight of his pieces have entered the Company’s repertoire including, most recently, Being and Nothingness performed on an international tour to Russia. His first full-length ballet Le Petit Prince was presented by The National Ballet to sold-out houses in 2016. In 2018, Mr. Côté created in collaboration with the famed Director Robert Lepage, Frame by Frame, a new full-length evening. Mr. Côté is also the Artistic Director of the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur, one of the largest summer dance festivals in the country. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBallet Kelowna: taqəš and Other Works - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"
