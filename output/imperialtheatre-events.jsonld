Andersen’s stage presence is informed by decades of cutting his teeth in dusty clubs, dim-lit bars, and grand theatres all over the world, delivering moving performances that run the gamut from intimate to wall-shaking.

We’ve lived a life alongside this album. Dark Side of the Moon came out in 1973 and it was everywhere. The album cover prism was drawn on countless school binders. We started paying attention to the sound of cash registers, having a good stereo system was a thing. Classic Albums Live knows how to perform this album, it’s complex and full of soul. Just getting the alarm clocks together was a feat. All the little voices, then you had to find someone that could sing ‘great gig in the sky’. We did, and it’s joyous. The musicians care about this album; it was our flagship show in 2003. It’s the album that changed everything. It’s a masterpiece that will be remembered forever."

We’ve lived a life alongside this album. Dark Side of the Moon came out in 1973 and it was everywhere. The album cover prism was drawn on countless school binders. We started paying attention to the sound of cash registers, having a good stereo system was a thing. Classic Albums Live knows how to perform this album, it’s complex and full of soul. Just getting the alarm clocks together was a feat. All the little voices, then you had to find someone that could sing ‘great gig in the sky’. We did, and it’s joyous. The musicians care about this album; it was our flagship show in 2003. It’s the album that changed everything. It’s a masterpiece that will be remembered forever.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "She was born in the township of KwaZakhele in the Eastern Cape and raised by her single mother named Kwazibani (which means “Who Knows?” in Xhosa) while her father was serving a 21-year prison sentence. A domestic worker by day, Kwazibani was a “Sangoma” or “African medicine woman” with a natural gift for music. Nomfusi would accompany her mother to weekly Sangoma rituals known as “Intlombe,” where she soon developed a love for performing and crafted her artistic identity by dancing and singing for hours. Tragically in 1998, Nomfusi was suddenly orphaned at age twelve when she lost her mother to HIV/AIDS. Nomfusi’s aunt took her and her siblings in, but sadly also succumbed to the same deadly disease three years later. Undeterred by the hand she was dealt at such a young age, Nomfusi turned her situation around to become one of South Africa's brightest, most recognizable stars. Never one for self-pity, Nomfusi strives to inspire others with her worldview that “life is about choices” and that \"one has to overcome the poverty of the mind first.” Her compassion has led her to doing outreach work at schools for at-risk youth in Soweto, Swaziland, and Malawi, and creating opportunities she didn’t have for the next generation. Additionally, she recently became an ambassador for MES, a Hillbrow-based NPO that helps homeless individuals get back on their feet and reintegrate into society. &nbsp;"

A domestic worker by day, Kwazibani was a “Sangoma” or “African medicine woman” with a natural gift for music. Nomfusi would accompany her mother to weekly Sangoma rituals known as “Intlombe,” where she soon developed a love for performing and crafted her artistic identity by dancing and singing for hours.\nTragically in 1998, Nomfusi was suddenly orphaned at age twelve when she lost her mother to HIV/AIDS. Nomfusi’s aunt took her and her siblings in, but sadly also succumbed to the same deadly disease three years later. Undeterred by the hand she was dealt at such a young age, Nomfusi turned her situation around to become one of South Africa’s brightest, most recognizable stars. Never one for self-pity, Nomfusi strives to inspire others with her worldview that “life is about choices” and that “one has to overcome the poverty of the mind first.” Her compassion has led her to doing outreach work at schools for at-risk youth in Soweto, Swaziland, and Malawi, and creating opportunities she didn’t have for the next generation. Additionally, she recently became an ambassador for MES, a Hillbrow-based NPO that helps homeless individuals get back on their feet and reintegrate into society.\n \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNomfusi - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

This year’s program combines carefully selected and thoughtfully prepared performances from the local Chinese community with the support and participation of some of Saint John’s and New Brunswick’s most respected artists and ensembles. Featured appearances include the Saint John String Quartet, the Saint John Youth Orchestra, the Oberig Choir and Saint John High School Choir. The gala also welcomes Chen Fei, a nationally recognized performer of Chinese traditional instruments, whose work adds a distinctive musical voice to the program. With guidance from experienced local musicians and ensembles, this year’s community- led performances move beyond familiar formats, creating moments of contrast, collaboration, and fresh cultural exchange on stage. A new stage and visual design, created specifically for this year’s production, offers a refreshing and immersive theatre experience. The show will also include a special guest appearance by James Mullinger, a British comedian based in greater Saint John, who has taken Canada by storm and will take part in selected moments of this show. Designed as a family-friendly event, the Lunar New Year Gala offers audiences a lively and engaging way to welcome the lunar new year at the Imperial Theatre."

The show will also include a special\nguest appearance by James Mullinger, a British comedian based in greater Saint\nJohn, who has taken Canada by storm and will take part in selected moments of this\nshow.\nDesigned as a family-friendly event, the Lunar New Year Gala offers audiences a lively\nand engaging way to welcome the lunar new year at the Imperial Theatre.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Presented by Walmart on tour from September 2025. In this a-MEOW-zing new live show, Gabby unboxes a special acorn that needs the magical touch of a rainbow to grow. But when CatRat causes a color cat-astrophe and breaks the rainbow, Gabby and the Gabby Cats must find the colors again to set things right. Gabby’s Dollhouse Live! Presented by Walmart brings to life an original story featuring incredible puppets, dynamic staging, and songs that will have audiences singing and dancing along, from beginning to end.\nTickets on sale now – sign up at www.gabbysdollhouselive.com for pre-sale access.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

With powerful poetry, compelling storytelling and unforgettable performances, it brings the ocean’s rich voices to life - exploring cultural struggle, joy, and identity across the islands. Following its sold-out season at the Sydney Opera House, UPU continues to captivate audiences around the world. Poems as broad and deep as the Pacific Ocean itself &nbsp; UPU-meaning ‘word’ in many different languages of the Pacific Islands - is a collection of voices from a people who live on a sea of islands connected by the largest body of water on earth, known as Te Moana Nui a Kiwa, the Pacific Ocean. Through the words of 23 poets, ranging from emerging voices to acclaimed literary figures, UPU weaves a rich tapestry of stories, experiences and perspectives from First Nations peoples of the islands. These poems reflect on cultural identity, history and the challenges faced by Pacific communities-from Hawaiians debating Captain Cook’s legacy, to the joys of SPAM in Guam and other Americanised islands, to the Marshall Islands’ struggle against rising seas. Poetry is powerful on the page - but on stage, it’s pure magic. The show’s energy comes alive through a cast of extraordinary Pacific performers, each with a rich background in theatre, film and television, whose passionate delivery of these words will transport you across the ocean. Enhanced by evocative lighting, projections, and a multi-layered soundscape, UPU is an intimate and unforgettable experience - a celebration of the Pacific, its people, and their stories. All poems are performed in English. &nbsp; Run time The duration of this event is 60 minutes. Event duration is a guide only and may be subject to change. &nbsp; Age Recommended for ages 15+ Performances will contain strobe lighting, strong language and adult themes. Children aged 15 years and under must be accompanied at all times. &nbsp; UPU features published works of the following poets: Tusiata Avia, Ben Brown, Brandy Nālani McDougall, Craig Santos Perez, Sia Figiel, Briar Grace-Smith, Daren Kamali, Karlo Mila, Grace Mera Molisa, Noʻu Revilla, Celestine Kulagoe, John Pule, Tafea Polamalu, Leilani Tamu, Apirana Taylor, Teresia Teaiwa, Hone Tuwhare, Selina Tusitala Marsh, Kathy Jetñil-Kijiner, Konai Helu Thaman, Albert Leomala, Maualaivao Albert Wendt and Lyz Soto. &nbsp; CREATIVES &nbsp; UPU COLLECTIVE Artistic Director &amp; Co-Creator: Fasitua Amosa Curator &amp; Co-Creator: Grace Iwashita-Taylor Producer: Ana Corbett &nbsp; Production Manager &amp; Sound Engineer: Emily Hakaraia Lighting &amp; Projection Design: Rowan Pierce Soundscape Design &amp; Original Composition: Faiumu Matthew Salapu Set Design: Michael McCabe Costume Design: Kristin Seth Artist &amp; Cultural Design Elements (Mamanu Design): Tyla Vaeau Movement &amp; Choreography: Joash Fahitua Tech Operator: Elekis Poblete Stage Manager: Eliza Rutter &nbsp; CAST Fasitua Amosa Ana Corbett Nicola Kāwana Miriama McDowell Shadon Meredith Jarod Rāwiri"

With powerful poetry, compelling storytelling and unforgettable performances, it brings the ocean’s rich voices to life – exploring cultural struggle, joy, and identity across the islands. Following its sold-out season at the Sydney Opera House, UPU continues to captivate audiences around the world.\nPoems as broad and deep as the Pacific Ocean itself\n \nUPU-meaning ‘word’ in many different languages of the Pacific Islands – is a collection of voices from a people who live on a sea of islands connected by the largest body of water on earth, known as Te Moana Nui a Kiwa, the Pacific Ocean.\nThrough the words of 23 poets, ranging from emerging voices to acclaimed literary figures, UPU weaves a rich tapestry of stories, experiences and perspectives from First Nations peoples of the islands.\nThese poems reflect on cultural identity, history and the challenges faced by Pacific communities-from Hawaiians debating Captain Cook’s legacy, to the joys of SPAM in Guam and other Americanised islands, to the Marshall Islands’ struggle against rising seas.\nPoetry is powerful on the page – but on stage, it’s pure magic. The show’s energy comes alive through a cast of extraordinary Pacific performers, each with a rich background in theatre, film and television, whose passionate delivery of these words will transport you across the ocean.\nEnhanced by evocative lighting, projections, and a multi-layered soundscape, UPU is an intimate and unforgettable experience – a celebration of the Pacific, its people, and their stories.\nAll poems are performed in English.\n \nRun time\nThe duration of this event is 60 minutes.\nEvent duration is a guide only and may be subject to change.\n \nAge\nRecommended for ages 15+\nPerformances will contain strobe lighting, strong language and adult themes. Children aged 15 years and under must be accompanied at all times.\n \nUPU features published works of the following poets:\nTusiata Avia, Ben Brown, Brandy Nālani McDougall, Craig Santos Perez, Sia Figiel, Briar Grace-Smith, Daren Kamali, Karlo Mila, Grace Mera Molisa, Noʻu Revilla, Celestine Kulagoe, John Pule, Tafea Polamalu, Leilani Tamu, Apirana Taylor, Teresia Teaiwa, Hone Tuwhare, Selina Tusitala Marsh, Kathy Jetñil-Kijiner, Konai Helu Thaman, Albert Leomala, Maualaivao Albert Wendt and Lyz Soto.\n \nCREATIVES\n \nUPU COLLECTIVE\nArtistic Director & Co-Creator: Fasitua Amosa Curator & Co-Creator: Grace Iwashita-Taylor Producer: Ana Corbett\n \nProduction Manager & Sound Engineer: Emily Hakaraia\nLighting & Projection Design: Rowan Pierce\nSoundscape Design & Original Composition: Faiumu Matthew Salapu\nSet Design: Michael McCabe\nCostume Design: Kristin Seth\nArtist & Cultural Design Elements (Mamanu Design): Tyla Vaeau\nMovement & Choreography: Joash Fahitua\nTech Operator: Elekis Poblete\nStage Manager: Eliza Rutter\n \nCAST\nFasitua Amosa\nAna Corbett\nNicola Kāwana\nMiriama McDowell\nShadon Meredith\nJarod Rāwiri\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUPU Collective - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

While upholding his status as a perennial merrymaker -- a reputation burnished by his years with acclaimed folk-pop combo Great Big Sea -- the new album also finds the multifaceted singer-songwriter and 14-time JUNO Award nominee exploring novel sonic terrain. Alongside marquee co-writers Jimmy Rankin, Donovan Woods, and Hollywood actor Oscar Isaac (yep, of Star Wars fame), Doyle presents nine original songs that are both typically buoyant and surprisingly intimate, what Doyle refers to as \"the lower and slower: the lower part of my vocal range and the slower songs. I'm letting myself do that for the first time on this records,\" which he cut in Montreal with producer-engineer Marcus Paquin. Doyle's CV is extensive -- he is a thrice-published author, a film and TV actor-producer with multiple major credits, and the co-producer of the recently released, 20-song Ron Hynes tribute album, Sonny Don't Go Away. Yet the wildly popular musician from Petty Harbour, Newfoundland remains the most electrifying before a live audience, abetted by his ace band. \"I am the luckiest guy in the world,\" Doyle says. \"It's such a privilege to stand among those players on stage.\" &nbsp;"

While upholding his status as a perennial merrymaker — a reputation burnished by his years with acclaimed folk-pop combo Great Big Sea — the new album also finds the multifaceted singer-songwriter and 14-time JUNO Award nominee exploring novel sonic terrain. Alongside marquee co-writers Jimmy Rankin, Donovan Woods, and Hollywood actor Oscar Isaac (yep, of Star Wars fame), Doyle presents nine original songs that are both typically buoyant and surprisingly intimate, what Doyle refers to as “the lower and slower: the lower part of my vocal range and the slower songs. I’m letting myself do that for the first time on this records,” which he cut in Montreal with producer-engineer Marcus Paquin. Doyle’s CV is extensive — he is a thrice-published author, a film and TV actor-producer with multiple major credits, and the co-producer of the recently released, 20-song Ron Hynes tribute album, Sonny Don’t Go Away. Yet the wildly popular musician from Petty Harbour, Newfoundland remains the most electrifying before a live audience, abetted by his ace band. “I am the luckiest guy in the world,” Doyle says. “It’s such a privilege to stand among those players on stage.”\n\n \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Disguised as men, Irish swashbuckler Anne Bonny and English privateer-turned-pirate Mary Read looted, plundered and outfought many of their male counterparts throughout the Caribbean before being captured and sentenced to hang. Clashing sword fights, brutal wrestling matches and sharp-as-a-blade humour bring these historical figures to the stage to explore what a life well lived truly is.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTheatre New Brunswick: Heroine - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Expansive and declarative, Further From the Country is the work of an artist who meets the challenge of putting incisive and enduring words to this age of uncertainty. William Prince’s perspective - a songwriter who carries great legacies of family and songcraft forward - is singular and significant. Further From the Country, his fifth LP, is an extraordinary work of observation, reflection and ambition, a work that will leave its mark on listeners for its humanity and its potency. The two-time JUNO Award winning artist continues to build an exceptional body of acclaimed work, with recent accolades including the John Prine Songwriter Fellowship and Americana Honors &amp; Awards nomination. From Newport Folk Festival to sold out shows at prestigious theatres including Massey Hall, from NPR’s Tiny Desk to tours with The War and Treaty, Yola and more, William Prince has made significant appearances on historic stages. Celebrated by peers, critics and fans, William Prince’s songs resonate on deep emotional levels. Now, with Further From the Country, Prince expands his sound and sharpens his focus for a collection of songs that share personal and universal truths alike. A commanding and accomplished album, Further From the Country signals an artist who has impelled his craft to formidable new heights."

Expansive and declarative, Further From the Country is the work of an artist who meets the challenge of putting incisive and enduring words to this age of uncertainty. William Prince’s perspective – a songwriter who carries great legacies of family and songcraft forward – is singular and significant. Further From the Country, his fifth LP, is an extraordinary work of observation, reflection and ambition, a work that will leave its mark on listeners for its humanity and its potency.\nThe two-time JUNO Award winning artist continues to build an exceptional body of acclaimed work, with recent accolades including the John Prine Songwriter Fellowship and Americana Honors & Awards nomination. From Newport Folk Festival to sold out shows at prestigious theatres including Massey Hall, from NPR’s Tiny Desk to tours with The War and Treaty, Yola and more, William Prince has made significant appearances on historic stages. Celebrated by peers, critics and fans, William Prince’s songs resonate on deep emotional levels.\nNow, with Further From the Country, Prince expands his sound and sharpens his focus for a collection of songs that share personal and universal truths alike. A commanding and accomplished album, Further From the Country signals an artist who has impelled his craft to formidable new heights.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWilliam Prince - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "Member pre-sale: Nov 7 | Public onsale: Nov 10 Alex Mackenzie is taking the comedy world by storm, and his Never Been Better tour proves why. Mackenzie gave up everything: his house, his job, and even the respect of his family to pursue his stand-up dreams. He has never looked back. After years of relentless hustle, that gamble is paying off in a big way. As an independent artist from Prince George, BC, Alex has self-produced all of his own shows without the backing of a major label, and the results speak for themselves. With over 100 million views online, a feature on Amazon Prime, sold-out theatres across Canada and Australia, and an arena performance for over 2,000 fans, Alex is proving that betting on yourself can lead to something incredible. What truly sets Alex apart is the experience he creates. Known as the happiness cheerleader of comedy, his shows feel like you’re hanging out with your best friend: positive, interactive, and full of life. Every night is unique, with crowd work that makes the audience part of the story, brand-new material woven with deep life lessons, and the unmistakable passion of someone who risked it all to chase a dream. You might not remember every single joke, but you’ll always remember how it made you feel. Everyone will leave happier than when they arrived, carrying lifelong memories with their loved ones. Even after the lights go down, the joy from this night will stay with you."

Mackenzie gave up everything: his house, his job, and even the respect of his family to pursue his stand-up dreams. He has never looked back. After years of relentless hustle, that gamble is paying off in a big way. As an independent artist from Prince George, BC, Alex has self-produced all of his own shows without the backing of a major label, and the results speak for themselves. With over 100 million views online, a feature on Amazon Prime, sold-out theatres across Canada and Australia, and an arena performance for over 2,000 fans, Alex is proving that betting on yourself can lead to something incredible. What truly sets Alex apart is the experience he creates. Known as the happiness cheerleader of comedy, his shows feel like you’re hanging out with your best friend: positive, interactive, and full of life. Every night is unique, with crowd work that makes the audience part of the story, brand-new material woven with deep life lessons, and the unmistakable passion of someone who risked it all to chase a dream. You might not remember every single joke, but you’ll always remember how it made you feel. Everyone will leave happier than when they arrived, carrying lifelong memories with their loved ones. Even after the lights go down, the joy from this night will stay with you.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Mackenzie - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Tom is often called the godfather of the podcasting revolution, who inspired a generation of voices to find their platform.\n\n\nTom Green VIP Meet & Greet Add-On\n$62.50 // The VIP Meet & Greet will take place after the performance.

An honest interpretation from four warriors, deeply influenced and hailing from Montreal, Canada. Covering songs from their full works: Toolshed, Opiate, Undertow, Aenema, Salival, Lateralus, 10 000 Days &amp; Fear Inoculum. Parabolus is proud to present an authentic and vibrant tribute to the legendary band that is TOOL. The four members are inspired by their technically complex yet emotionally powerful music, their visual arts, philosophy and of course their unmatched live shows. From the die hard fans to the casual listeners who haven’t got the chance to see them live yet. Parabolus is dedicated 100% to recreate the closest experience of going to one of TOOL’s concerts to the best of our abilities. Our setlist includes TOOL’s famous songs but also a number of deeper cuts that have been repeatedly proven to satisfy everyone from casual to obsessive Tool fans. You want the sound, gears and ambience of the actual band? We’ve done the research and tracked down what was needed to give you the best possible experience. Open your Third Eye and prepare to be amazed!"

Covering songs from their full works: Toolshed, Opiate, Undertow, Aenema, Salival, Lateralus, 10 000 Days & Fear Inoculum. Parabolus is proud to present an authentic and vibrant tribute to the legendary band that is TOOL. The four members are inspired by their technically complex yet emotionally powerful music, their visual arts, philosophy and of course their unmatched live shows. From the die hard fans to the casual listeners who haven’t got the chance to see them live yet. Parabolus is dedicated 100% to recreate the closest experience of going to one of TOOL’s concerts to the best of our abilities. Our setlist includes TOOL’s famous songs but also a number of deeper cuts that have been repeatedly proven to satisfy everyone from casual to obsessive Tool fans. You want the sound, gears and ambience of the actual band? We’ve done the research and tracked down what was needed to give you the best possible experience.\nOpen your Third Eye and prepare to be amazed!\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Eight world class acrobats investigate physical skill; how we obtain it, how we perfect it, and how it can transform our lives. Through highlighting the nuance of high-level acrobatics, audiences experience a heightened appreciation of the countless hours required to master the skills they are witnessing. This is a love letter to our bodies and the amazing things they let us do every day. This is an invitation to watch us work.

One of the most successful and adored acts in musical history is recreated live in concert. You’ll hear hits like, “Staying Alive”, “You Should Be Dancing,” “How Deep Is Your Love,” and “Jive Talkin.” The performers’ authentic take on the trio’s clothes, style and moves showcase five decades of the Brothers Gibb’s success as rock and disco legends, while audiences groove to their memorable music and are immersed in the disco era. The President of the Bee Gees Fan Club, USA has said, “In my opinion they are the best Bee Gees tribute in the world!”\n\n \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "A Fun, Appealing Story William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream is one of his most beloved comedies. Four Athenians find themselves in a forest inhabited by fairies who manipulate the humans and are engaged in their own domestic intrigue. It is a lighthearted, humourous and fun tale of love and, often misguided, magic set in motion by the mischievous trickster Puck. The ballet adaptation is set to Mendelssohn’s 1827 concert overture and 1843 instrumental score which includes the famous “Wedding March.” Ballet: A Canadian Way Bengt Jörgen will bring this story to life in his own original ballet version as a tribute to Canada’s North. Ballet Jörgen’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream will bring out the magic of Northern Canada’s woodland and tundra landscapes and creatures of the forest such as moose, beavers, bears, and squirrels.

Four Athenians\nfind themselves in a forest inhabited by fairies who manipulate the humans and are engaged in their own\ndomestic intrigue. It is a lighthearted, humourous and fun tale of love and, often misguided, magic set in\nmotion by the mischievous trickster Puck. The ballet adaptation is set to Mendelssohn’s 1827 concert\noverture and 1843 instrumental score which includes the famous “Wedding March.”\nBallet: A Canadian Way\nBengt Jörgen will bring this story to life in his own original ballet version as a tribute to Canada’s North.\nBallet Jörgen’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream will bring out the magic of Northern Canada’s woodland and\ntundra landscapes and creatures of the forest such as moose, beavers, bears, and squirrels. In addition to\nour professional dancers, each performance will include up to 10 age-appropriate roles for local young\naspiring dancers, ages 9 to 17, through Ballet Jörgen’s Local Participant Program.\nBuilt for our Audience and Communities\nThis family-friendly short ballet will captivate audiences of all ages and will warm the hearts of young and\nold alike.\nCHOREOGRAPHER Bengt Jörgen C.M.\nMUSIC Felix Mendelssohn\nSET & COSTUME DESIGN Sue LePage\nLIGHTING DESIGN Madhu Seran\nSTAGE DIRECTION & DRAMA COACH Heinar Piller\n1 hour & 40 minutes w 1 intermission\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBallet Jörgen: Mid Summer Night’s Dream - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Yamoussa first became interested in the Circus Arts as a young man growing up in Conakry Guinea in the 1990’s.   He studied the circus performers he saw on European TV and practiced on the beach and dirt around his home. He also studied the Nyamakala tradition of circus, practiced by the Fula people of West Africa. He eventually joined Guinea’s original circus company, Circus Baobob. with whom he toured Africa and Europe.  With this company he was able to spend time in Spain and France where he honed many of the European style circus skills. In the early 2000’s, he was recruited to come to Canada with Cirque Eloize, a Montreal based Canadian cirque company.  [embed]https://youtu.be/7jmTvOG4jJI[/embed]"

Anchored by the evocative baritone of frontman Paul Murphy, alongside Loel Campbell’s hypnotic, propulsive drumming and Tim D’Eon’s shimmering guitar and piano work, the band conjures a sonic atmosphere that feels both vast and intimate. Their catalog, anchored by critically celebrated albums Untitled, Welcome to the Night Sky, Hello Hum, The Great Detachment and In the Land Of, occupies a distinct place in the Canadian indie rock canon, praised for its deft balance of haunting lyricism and cinematic grandeur. In 2025, Wintersleep brings with them a promise of immersive live performances—equal parts raw emotional catharsis and meticulously constructed sonic atmospheres. Longtime fans and new listeners alike will be drawn into the band’s enveloping soundscapes, where intimate confessions collide with epic swells of sound, capturing the delicate tension between vulnerability and grandeur that defines their music.

With Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe’s compelling taqəš, Alysa Pires’ striking Vestiges, and Guillaume Côté’s electrifying Le Carnaval des Animaux, this high-energy program from Canada’s leading dancemakers promises to please a wide range of spectators. Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe brings his classical ballet training, knowledge of traditional Coast Salish, Grass, and Hoop Dance, and experience as a contemporary dancer to taqəš [tawKESH], which means “to return something” in Ayajuthem, the language belonging to the Homalco, Klahoose, K’omoks, and Tla’amin Nations. Set to several songs by Polaris Prize-winning composer and singer Jeremy Dutcher, taqəš follows the traditional story “Raven Returns the Water,” centred around ῤoho (raven) and walθ (frog).  Next, award-winning choreographer Alysa Pires constructs a striking commentary on the search for true connection and meaning amid disorder. Set to the cinematic melodies of violinist Hilary Hahn and composer Hauschka, Vestiges highlights the virtuosity of Pires’ bold and lively choreography. Rounding out the program, Guillaume Côté, recently retired Principal Dancer and Chorographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada, applies his fresh, artistic vision to a jovial rendition of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Le Carnaval des Animaux, regarded as one of the French composer’s best-known works. Full of whimsical ornamentation, this upbeat ensemble piece pushes the limits of contemporary ballet and promises to delight audiences with its exuberant energy of frolicking and fun. taqəš Choreography: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe Music: Jeremy Dutcher, Oqiton, Essuwonike, Ultestakon | Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa Lighting Design: Rylee Block after James Proudfoot Costume Concept: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe Dancers: TBD Pause &nbsp; Vestiges Choreography: Alysa Pires Music: Hilary Hahn and Hauschka Lighting Design: Rylee Block Costume Concept: Alysa Pires Costume Couturier: Colleen Bryant | KOCO Dancers: TBD Intermission &nbsp; Le Carnaval des Animaux Choreography: Guillaume Côté Music: Camille Saint-Saëns, Le Carnaval des animaux Lighting Design: Rylee Block Costumes: TBD Dancers: TBD &nbsp; CAMERON sinkʷə FRASER-MONROE | Choreographer, taqəš Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe is a member of the Tla’amin First Nation. At three years old he started Ukrainian dancing in Vernon, BC. He was privileged to receive several years of training and performance with World Champion hoop dancer Dallas Arcand and studied grass dance with Elder Mollie Bono. Since graduating from the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School on the RWB Alumni Scholarship, he has performed with many companies including Dancers of Damelahamid at Kia Mau Festival in New Zealand and the International Cervantino Festival, Jera Wolfe at Jacob’s Pillow Festival, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet at the National Arts Centre, the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada, and Ballet Kelowna.  As a choreographer, Mr. Fraser-Monroe has received commissions from The National Ballet of Canada, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Fall for Dance Festival in NYC, Ballet Kelowna, the Winnipeg Summer Dance Collective, Whim W’Him Seattle, the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto, Artist’s Climate Collective, Transformation Cabaret at the Cultch, and both PULSE and Indigenous Day Live! on APTN. He continues to practice and present hoop dance. &nbsp; ALYSA PIRES | Choreographer, MAMBO Alysa Pires was born and raised on the traditional territory of the W̱SÁNEĆ people near Victoria, BC. She is an Honours BFA graduate of Toronto Metropolitan University and her choreographic works have been performed by companies such as The National Ballet of Canada, Alberta Ballet, Ballet Kelowna, Canada’s Ballet Jörgen, and Ballet Edmonton. Ms. Pires began working with the National Ballet of Canada as part of their Choreographic Workshop (2016-2018) where she created her critically acclaimed work In Between. She represented the company at the 13th International Competition for the Erik Bruhn Prize and was then appointed Choreographic Associate by Karen Kain, a position Ms. Pires held from 2019-2022. Ms. Pires recently became the first Canadian woman to create a work for New York City Ballet, making her Lincoln Center debut in May 2023 with Standard Deviation.  &nbsp; GUILLAUME CÔTÉ | Choreographer, Le Carnaval des Animaux Guillaume Côté studied at Canada’s National Ballet School and joined The National Ballet of Canada in 1998. He quickly rose through the ranks and was promoted to Principal Dancer in 2004. In 2013, in addition to his position as a Principal Dancer, Mr. Côté assumed the role of Choreographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada. Since then, eight of his pieces have entered the Company’s repertoire including, most recently, Being and Nothingness performed on an international tour to Russia. His first full-length ballet Le Petit Prince was presented by The National Ballet to sold-out houses in 2016. In 2018, Mr. Côté created in collaboration with the famed Director Robert Lepage, Frame by Frame, a new full-length evening. Mr. Côté is also the Artistic Director of the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur, one of the largest summer dance festivals in the country."

With Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe’s compelling taqəš, Alysa Pires’ striking Vestiges, and Guillaume Côté’s electrifying Le Carnaval des Animaux, this high-energy program from Canada’s leading dancemakers promises to please a wide range of spectators.\nCameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe brings his classical ballet training, knowledge of traditional Coast Salish, Grass, and Hoop Dance, and experience as a contemporary dancer to taqəš [tawKESH], which means “to return something” in Ayajuthem, the language belonging to the Homalco, Klahoose, K’omoks, and Tla’amin Nations. Set to several songs by Polaris Prize-winning composer and singer Jeremy Dutcher, taqəš follows the traditional story “Raven Returns the Water,” centred around ῤoho (raven) and walθ (frog). \nNext, award-winning choreographer Alysa Pires constructs a striking commentary on the search for true connection and meaning amid disorder. Set to the cinematic melodies of violinist Hilary Hahn and composer Hauschka, Vestiges highlights the virtuosity of Pires’ bold and lively choreography.\nRounding out the program, Guillaume Côté, recently retired Principal Dancer and Chorographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada, applies his fresh, artistic vision to a jovial rendition of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Le Carnaval des Animaux, regarded as one of the French composer’s best-known works. Full of whimsical ornamentation, this upbeat ensemble piece pushes the limits of contemporary ballet and promises to delight audiences with its exuberant energy of frolicking and fun.\ntaqəš\nChoreography: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe\nMusic: Jeremy Dutcher, Oqiton, Essuwonike, Ultestakon | Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa\nLighting Design: Rylee Block after James Proudfoot\nCostume Concept: Cameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe\nDancers: TBD\n\nPause\n \nVestiges\nChoreography: Alysa Pires\nMusic: Hilary Hahn and Hauschka\nLighting Design: Rylee Block\nCostume Concept: Alysa Pires\nCostume Couturier: Colleen Bryant | KOCO\nDancers: TBD\n\nIntermission\n \nLe Carnaval des Animaux\nChoreography: Guillaume Côté\nMusic: Camille Saint-Saëns, Le Carnaval des animaux\nLighting Design: Rylee Block\nCostumes: TBD\nDancers: TBD\n \nCAMERON sinkʷə FRASER-MONROE | Choreographer, taqəš \n\nCameron sinkʷə Fraser-Monroe is a member of the Tla’amin First Nation. At three years old he started Ukrainian dancing in Vernon, BC. He was privileged to receive several years of training and performance with World Champion hoop dancer Dallas Arcand and studied grass dance with Elder Mollie Bono. Since graduating from the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School on the RWB Alumni Scholarship, he has performed with many companies including Dancers of Damelahamid at Kia Mau Festival in New Zealand and the International Cervantino Festival, Jera Wolfe at Jacob’s Pillow Festival, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet at the National Arts Centre, the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada, and Ballet Kelowna. \nAs a choreographer, Mr. Fraser-Monroe has received commissions from The National Ballet of Canada, Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Fall for Dance Festival in NYC, Ballet Kelowna, the Winnipeg Summer Dance Collective, Whim W’Him Seattle, the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto, Artist’s Climate Collective, Transformation Cabaret at the Cultch, and both PULSE and Indigenous Day Live! on APTN. He continues to practice and present hoop dance.\n \nALYSA PIRES | Choreographer, MAMBO\n\nAlysa Pires was born and raised on the traditional territory of the W̱SÁNEĆ people near Victoria, BC. She is an Honours BFA graduate of Toronto Metropolitan University and her choreographic works have been performed by companies such as The National Ballet of Canada, Alberta Ballet, Ballet Kelowna, Canada’s Ballet Jörgen, and Ballet Edmonton. Ms. Pires began working with the National Ballet of Canada as part of their Choreographic Workshop (2016-2018) where she created her critically acclaimed work In Between. She represented the company at the 13th International Competition for the Erik Bruhn Prize and was then appointed Choreographic Associate by Karen Kain, a position Ms. Pires held from 2019-2022. Ms. Pires recently became the first Canadian woman to create a work for New York City Ballet, making her Lincoln Center debut in May 2023 with Standard Deviation. \n \nGUILLAUME CÔTÉ | Choreographer, Le Carnaval des Animaux\n\nGuillaume Côté studied at Canada’s National Ballet School and joined The National Ballet of Canada in 1998. He quickly rose through the ranks and was promoted to Principal Dancer in 2004. In 2013, in addition to his position as a Principal Dancer, Mr. Côté assumed the role of Choreographic Associate with The National Ballet of Canada. Since then, eight of his pieces have entered the Company’s repertoire including, most recently, Being and Nothingness performed on an international tour to Russia. His first full-length ballet Le Petit Prince was presented by The National Ballet to sold-out houses in 2016. In 2018, Mr. Côté created in collaboration with the famed Director Robert Lepage, Frame by Frame, a new full-length evening. Mr. Côté is also the Artistic Director of the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur, one of the largest summer dance festivals in the country. \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPerformer's Website Page\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBallet Kelowna: taqəš and Other Works - Official Website\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

Delivering track after track with unparalleled quality and consistency, Hicks’ ascent as an elite chart-topping act since making his country-label debut in 2013 is undeniable. His vast catalogue of highly praised releases including Throw Down, 5:01, 5:01+, Shake These Walls, New Tattoo, Wreck This, Campfire Troubadour and Talk To Time has earned the five-time JUNO Award nominee and CCMA Award winner a DOUBLE PLATINUM selling single, five PLATINUM selling singles, nine GOLD singles, one GOLD album and seventeen Top 10 radio hits (including the #1 singles “No Truck Song” and “What A Song Should Do”), in addition to over 220 million collective streams, 35 million YouTube views, multiple sold-out headlining dates and back-to-back national tours. Hicks, a 2022 JUNO Award nominee for ‘Country Album of the Year’ is now a three-time consecutive winner (and the first recipient ever) of the Nielsen Compass Award, which recognizes an artist for the most total content plays including streams, single and album sales as well as total social media following. In 2022, Hicks set out on his national headlining 2022 ZERO to SIXTY Tour and released his fifth full-length album ‘Talk To Time,’ a timeless collection showcasing back-to-back-back (3 consecutive) Top 10 singles at country radio. 2023 saw the re-release of Tim’s Gold-Certified album Throw Down Deluxe (Remastered) featuring the never-before-heard track \"Taking It Easy,\" along with a brand new version of the fan favourite \"Stronger Beer (Keg Party Mix)\". That was followed by the release of Campfire Troubadour Volume II, the next installment following the Juno and CCMA-nominated predecessor of the same name. Tim was nominated for Fans’ Choice and Album of the Year (Talk to Time) at the 2023 CCMA Awards and wrapped his Campfire Troubadour 2023 headline tour across Canada in the fall. In 2024, Tim released the heartfelt ballad \"Last Two Lonely Hearts,\" followed by his summer anthem and Top 20 Billboard charting hit \"One More\", and the nostalgic \"I Miss Tom Petty”. He also took his high-energy live show on the road, performing in Germany, the UK, Latvia, and Australia. Fresh off the heels of his single “Quits”, Hicks is wrapping a busy 2025 with the release of his brand new single \"Going Somewhere”, out everywhere and at Country radio now. Fans can expect Hicks’ signature grit and powerhouse delivery, paired with a fresh edge that proves he’s continuing to evolve as an artist while staying true to his roots. &nbsp;"

Delivering track after track with unparalleled quality and consistency, Hicks’ ascent as an elite chart-topping act since making his country-label debut in 2013 is undeniable. His vast catalogue of highly praised releases including Throw Down, 5:01, 5:01+, Shake These Walls, New Tattoo, Wreck This, Campfire Troubadour and Talk To Time has earned the five-time JUNO Award nominee and CCMA Award winner a DOUBLE PLATINUM selling single, five PLATINUM selling singles, nine GOLD singles, one GOLD album and seventeen Top 10 radio hits (including the #1 singles “No Truck Song” and “What A Song Should Do”), in addition to over 220 million collective streams, 35 million YouTube views, multiple sold-out headlining dates and back-to-back national tours. Hicks, a 2022 JUNO Award nominee for ‘Country Album of the Year’ is now a three-time consecutive winner (and the first recipient ever) of the Nielsen Compass Award, which recognizes an artist for the most total content plays including streams, single and album sales as well as total social media following. In 2022, Hicks set out on his national headlining 2022 ZERO to SIXTY Tour and released his fifth full-length album ‘Talk To Time,’ a timeless collection showcasing back-to-back-back (3 consecutive) Top 10 singles at country radio. 2023 saw the re-release of Tim’s Gold-Certified album Throw Down Deluxe (Remastered) featuring the never-before-heard track “Taking It Easy,” along with a brand new version of the fan favourite “Stronger Beer (Keg Party Mix)”. That was followed by the release of Campfire Troubadour Volume II, the next installment following the Juno and CCMA-nominated predecessor of the same name. Tim was nominated for Fans’ Choice and Album of the Year (Talk to Time) at the 2023 CCMA Awards and wrapped his Campfire Troubadour 2023 headline tour across Canada in the fall. In 2024, Tim released the heartfelt ballad “Last Two Lonely Hearts,” followed by his summer anthem and Top 20 Billboard charting hit “One More”, and the nostalgic “I Miss Tom Petty”. He also took his high-energy live show on the road, performing in Germany, the UK, Latvia, and Australia. Fresh off the heels of his single “Quits”, Hicks is wrapping a busy 2025 with the release of his brand new single “Going Somewhere”, out everywhere and at Country radio now. Fans can expect Hicks’ signature grit and powerhouse delivery, paired with a fresh edge that proves he’s continuing to evolve as an artist while staying true to his roots.\n \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

On Saturday, October 3, 2026, the historic Imperial Theatre will come alive with the sights, sounds, and emotions of Canada’s favourite band. Grace, 2 delivers a performance that goes far beyond a simple tribute—it is a celebration of the music that has woven itself into the fabric of our lives. More Than Just Music To truly honour the legacy of Gord Downie, Grace, 2 believes we must use the power and inﬂuence of The Tragically Hip’s music to drive change. Gord asked us all to \"do something,\" and so we shall. United by the soundtrack of a generation, this event aims to raise vital funds and awareness for The Canadian Cancer Society. By gathering to sing the songs we love, we are also joining in the ﬁght for a future where no one has to face cancer alone. What to Expect: • A Faithful Tribute: An energetic, passionate performance capturing the spirit of The Hip’s live shows. • Iconic Venue: Experience these legendary songs in the stunning acoustics of the \"most beautifully restored theatre in Canada,\" the Imperial Theatre. • A Meaningful Cause: In support of the he Canadian Cancer Society. Come for the memories and to support a great cause. Let’s raise the roof and raise hope, together. \"We don't imitate, we celebrate. We perform to evoke those cherished memories and emotions that are forever linked to The Hip's music, while honuoring the indelible legacy of Gord Downie.\" — Grace, 2"

Grace, 2 delivers a performance that goes far beyond a simple tribute—it is a celebration of the music that has woven itself into the fabric of our lives.\nMore Than Just Music To truly honour the legacy of Gord Downie, Grace, 2 believes we must use the power and inﬂuence of The Tragically Hip’s music to drive change. Gord asked us all to “do something,” and so we shall.\nUnited by the soundtrack of a generation, this event aims to raise vital funds and awareness for The Canadian Cancer Society. By gathering to sing the songs we love, we are also joining in the ﬁght for a future where no one has to face cancer alone.\nWhat to Expect:\n• A Faithful Tribute: An energetic, passionate performance capturing the spirit of The Hip’s live shows.\n• Iconic Venue: Experience these legendary songs in the stunning acoustics of the “most beautifully restored theatre in Canada,” the Imperial Theatre.\n• A Meaningful Cause: In support of the he Canadian Cancer Society.\nCome for the memories and to support a great cause.\nLet’s raise the roof and raise hope, together. “We don’t imitate, we celebrate. We perform to evoke those cherished memories and emotions that are forever linked to The Hip’s music, while honuoring the indelible legacy of Gord Downie.” — Grace, 2\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

        "@value": "ext fall, award-winning Canadian singer/songwriter, Loreena McKennitt, will be commemorating the 30th anniversary of her album, The Mask and Mirror, with an extensive tour of Eastern Canada. Widely acclaimed for its ‘cross-cultural fertilization’, the album weaves together Celtic, Spanish and Moroccan influences. Loreena will be accompanied by musical companions Caroline Lavelle on cello, Brian Hughes on guitar, Hugh Marsh on violin, Dudley Phillips on bass and Robert Brian on drums. The first set each evening will feature fan favourites, while the second set will include every song on the album. McKennitt proclaims, “This is a milestone anniversary in my career, and I look forward to celebrating it at home.”  Her eclectic Celtic blend of pop, folk and world music has sold more than 14 million albums worldwide, and her recordings have achieved Gold, Platinum and multi-Platinum status in 15 countries, on four continents. McKennitt proclaims she followed “paths of inspiration” and that the album “examines the questions that echo down the centuries – Who was God? What is religion, what spirituality? What was revealed and what was concealed and what was the mask and what the mirror?” The first set each evening will feature ‘fan favourites’, while the second set will include every song on the album. Loreena will be accompanied by musical companions Caroline Lavelle on cello, Brian Hughes on guitar, Hugh Marsh on violin, Dudley Phillips on bass and Robert Brian on drums. “This album was a historical and musical pilgrimage for me and I’m thrilled to bring this concert home,” McKennitt states. “This is a milestone anniversary in my career and I look forward to celebrating it with Canadian audiences, including Atlantic Canada where we have not performed in a decade.” McKennitt’s eclectic Celtic blend of pop, folk and world music has sold more than 14 million albums worldwide. Her recordings have achieved Gold, Platinum and multi-Platinum status in 15 countries on four continents. She has twice been nominated for a GRAMMY® Award and has won two Juno Awards, as well as a Billboard International Achievement Award. McKennitt was inducted into the Canadian Songwriter’s Hall of Fame in March 2023 and The Canadian Music Hall of Fame in May 2025."

Widely acclaimed for its ‘cross-cultural fertilization’, the album weaves together Celtic, Spanish and Moroccan influences.\n\n\nLoreena will be accompanied by musical companions Caroline Lavelle on cello, Brian Hughes on guitar, Hugh Marsh on violin, Dudley Phillips on bass and Robert Brian on drums. The first set each evening will feature fan favourites, while the second set will include every song on the album.\nMcKennitt proclaims, “This is a milestone anniversary in my career, and I look forward to celebrating it at home.”  Her eclectic Celtic blend of pop, folk and world music has sold more than 14 million albums worldwide, and her recordings have achieved Gold, Platinum and multi-Platinum status in 15 countries, on four continents.\n\n\nMcKennitt proclaims she followed “paths of inspiration” and that the album\n“examines the questions that echo down the centuries – Who was God?\nWhat is religion, what spirituality? What was revealed and what was\nconcealed and what was the mask and what the mirror?”\nThe first set each evening will feature ‘fan favourites’, while the second set\nwill include every song on the album. Loreena will be accompanied by\nmusical companions Caroline Lavelle on cello, Brian Hughes on guitar,\nHugh Marsh on violin, Dudley Phillips on bass and Robert Brian on drums.\n“This album was a historical and musical pilgrimage for me and I’m thrilled\nto bring this concert home,” McKennitt states. “This is a milestone\nanniversary in my career and I look forward to celebrating it with Canadian\naudiences, including Atlantic Canada where we have not performed in a\ndecade.”\nMcKennitt’s eclectic Celtic blend of pop, folk and world music has sold\nmore than 14 million albums worldwide. Her recordings have achieved\nGold, Platinum and multi-Platinum status in 15 countries on four continents.\nShe has twice been nominated for a GRAMMY® Award and has won two\nJuno Awards, as well as a Billboard International Achievement\nAward. McKennitt was inducted into the Canadian Songwriter’s Hall of\nFame in March 2023 and The Canadian Music Hall of Fame in May 2025.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t"

After twelve years of living in Saint John, he loves this place more than ever, and there is nowhere he would rather wrap up a fifty-four date cross Canada tour. Join him on Thursday 17 December for a festive night of stand up comedy filled with brand new material and stories from a year spent travelling the country, learning the joys and disasters of performing in every province, and navigating life, work, family and fun. This final performance of James’s tour is his Christmas gift to the city that has given him everything. It is the perfect seasonal night out for couples, friends, colleagues and comedy lovers. Come celebrate Christmas with James and enjoy a night of big laughs in one of the most beautiful theatres in the country. It’s a Very Mullinger Christmas at the Imperial… Be sure to book early before it sells out."
